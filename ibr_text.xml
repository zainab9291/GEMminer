    abstract "BACKGROUND: Anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) and
 citrullinated proteins play key roles in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid
 arthritis (RA). Many candidate citrullinated antigens have been identified in
 joints, but citrullinated proteins in sera are mostly uncertain in patients
 with RA. We explored the expression of citrullinated proteins in joints and
 sera of experimental arthritis, and we further investigated their specific
 expression correlated with the disease activity in patients with RA. METHODS:
 Citrullinated protein expression in tissues was examined by IHC in peptide
 glucose-6-phosphate isomerase-induced arthritis (pGIA). Serum citrullinated
 proteins from pGIA were examined by Western blotting, and the sequence was
 identified by MS. With the same methods, serum citrullinated proteins were
 analyzed in patients with RA, primary Sjogren's syndrome, systemic lupus
 erythematosus, and osteoarthritis as well as in healthy subjects, by Western
 blotting and MS. In patients with RA, the relationship between the expression
 of the identified protein (inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 4
 [ITIH4]) and clinical features was evaluated, and the levels of citrullinated
 ITIH4 were compared before and after biological treatment. The antibody
 response against citrullinated ITIH4 peptide was measured by enzyme-linked
 immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Citrullinated proteins were detected
 specifically in arthritic joints and sera from pGIA relative to controls. In
 sera, a common band of citrullinated protein at 120 kDa was revealed, and it
 fluctuated in parallel with arthritis score of pGIA by Western blotting.
 Interestingly, in 82% of RA patient sera, similar bands of citrullinated
 protein were specifically detected. These proteins were identified as
 citrullinated ITIH4, and especially the R438 site was commonly citrullinated
 between mice and humans. Citrullinated ITIH4 levels were associated with
 clinical parameters such as C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor, and
 Disease Activity Score in 28 joints as measured by CRP in patients with RA.
 Its levels were decreased in correlation with the reduction of disease
 activity score after effective treatment in patients with RA. Moreover,
 antibody response to citrullinated epitope in ITIH4 was specifically observed
 in patients with RA. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that serum
 citrullinated ITIH4 was specifically increased in patients with RA and could
 be a novel biomarker for assessing disease activity in patients with RA.",

    abstract "OBJECTIVES: Primary gout is a major disease that affects human
 health; however, its pathogenesis is not well known. The purpose of this
 study was to identify biomarkers to explore the underlying mechanisms of
 primary gout. METHODS: We used the isobaric tags for relative and absolute
 quantitation (iTRAQ) technique combined with liquid chromatography-tandem
 mass spectrometry to screen differentially expressed proteins between gout
 patients and controls. We also identified proteins potentially involved in
 gout pathogenesis by analysing biological processes, cellular components,
 molecular functions, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways
 and protein-protein interactions. We further verified some samples using
 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Statistical analyses were carried
 out using SPSS v. 20.0 and ROC (receiver operating characterstic) curve
 analyses were carried out using Medcalc software. Two-sided p-values <0.05
 were deemed to be statistically significant for all analyses. RESULTS: We
 identified 95 differentially expressed proteins (50 up-regulated and 45
 down-regulated), and selected nine proteins (alpha-enolase (ENOA),
 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3P), complement component C9
 (CO9), profilin-1 (PROF1), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), tubulin
 beta-4A chain (TBB4A), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1), glucose-6-phosphate
 isomerase (G6PI), and transketolase (TKT)) for verification. This showed that
 the level of TBB4A was significantly higher in primary gout than in controls
 (p=0.023). CONCLUSIONS: iTRAQ technology was useful in the selection of
 differentially expressed proteins from proteomes, and provides a strong
 theoretical basis for the study of biomarkers and mechanisms in primary gout.
 In addition, TBB4A protein may be associated with primary gout.",

    abstract "The HarvestPlus program for cassava ( Crantz) fortifies cassava
 with beta-carotene by breeding for carotene-rich tubers (yellow cassava).
 However, a negative correlation between yellowness and dry matter (DM)
 content has been identified. We investigated the genetic control of DM in
 white and yellow cassava. We used regional heritability mapping (RHM) to
 associate DM with genomic segments in both subpopulations. Significant
 segments were subjected to candidate gene analysis and candidates were
 validated with prediction accuracies. The RHM procedure was validated via a
 simulation approach and revealed significant hits for white cassava on
 chromosomes 1, 4, 5, 10, 17, and 18, whereas hits for the yellow were on
 chromosome 1. Candidate gene analysis revealed genes in the carbohydrate
 biosynthesis pathway including plant serine-threonine protein kinases
 (SnRKs), UDP (uridine diphosphate)-glycosyltransferases, UDP-sugar
 transporters, invertases, pectinases, and regulons. Validation using 1252
 unique identifiers from the SnRK gene family genome-wide recovered 50% of the
 predictive accuracy of whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphisms for DM,
 whereas validation using 53 likely genes (extracted from the literature) from
 significant segments recovered 32%. Genes including an acid invertase, a
 neutral or alkaline invertase, and a glucose-6-phosphate isomerase were
 validated on the basis of an a priori list for the cassava starch pathway,
 and also a fructose-biphosphate aldolase from the Calvin cycle pathway. The
 power of the RHM procedure was estimated as 47% when the causal quantitative
 trait loci generated 10% of the phenotypic variance (sample size = 451).
 Cassava DM genetics are complex and RHM may be useful for complex traits.",

    abstract "Multiple myeloma (MM), the second most common hematologic
 malignancy, is an incurable disease characterized by the accumulation of
 malignant plasma cells within the bone marrow. Though great progresses have
 been made in understanding the mechanisms of MM, metabolic plasticity and
 drug resistance remain largely unknown. In this study, we found lncRNA
 Protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3 pseudogene 1 (PDIA3P) is highly
 expressed in MM and is associated with the survival rate of MM patients.
 PDIA3P regulates MM growth and drug resistance through Glucose 6-phosphate
 dehydrogenase (G6PD) and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP).
 Mechanistically, we revealed that PDIA3P interacts with c-Myc to enhance its
 transactivation activity and binding to G6PD promoter, stimulating G6PD
 expression and PPP flux. Our study identified PDIA3P as a novel c-Myc
 interacting lncRNA and elucidated crucial roles for PDIA3P in metabolic
 regulation of MM, providing a potential therapeutic target for MM patients.",

    abstract "Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), a biodegradable polymer accumulated
 by bacteria is deposited intracellularly in the form of inclusion bodies
 often called granules. The granules are supramolecular complexes harbouring a
 varied number of proteins on their surface, which have specific but
 incompletely characterised functions. By comparison with other organisms that
 produce biodegradable polymers, only two phasins have been described to date
 for Rhodosprillum rubrum, raising the possibility that more await discovery.
 Using a comparative proteomics strategy to compare the granules of wild-type
 R. rubrum with a PHB-negative mutant housing artificial PHB granules, we
 identified four potential PHB granules' associated proteins. These were:
 Q2RSI4, an uncharacterised protein; Q2RWU9, annotated as an extracellular
 solute-binding protein; Q2RQL4, annotated as basic membrane lipoprotein; and
 Q2RQ51, annotated as glucose-6-phosphate isomerase. In silico analysis
 revealed that Q2RSI4 harbours a Phasin_2 family domain and shares low
 identity with a single-strand DNA-binding protein from Sphaerochaeta
 coccoides. Fluorescence microscopy found that three proteins Q2RSI4, Q2EWU9
 and Q2RQL4 co-localised with PHB granules. This work adds three potential new
 granule associated proteins to the repertoire of factors involved in
 bacterial storage granule formation, and confirms that proteomics screens are
 an effective strategy for discovery of novel granule associated proteins.",

    abstract "Cryptosporidium parvum is a water-borne and food-borne
 apicomplexan pathogen. It is one of the top four diarrheal-causing pathogens
 in children under the age of five in developing countries, and an
 opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised individuals. Unlike other
 apicomplexans, C. parvum lacks Kreb's cycle and cytochrome-based respiration,
 thus relying mainly on glycolysis to produce ATP. In this study, we
 characterized the primary biochemical features of the C. parvum
 glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (CpGPI) and determined its Michaelis constant
 towards fructose-6-phosphate (Km=0.309mM, Vmax=31.72nmol/mug/min). We also
 discovered that ebselen, an organoselenium drug, was a selective inhibitor of
 CpGPI by high-throughput screening of 1200 known drugs. Ebselen acted on
 CpGPI as an allosteric noncompetitive inhibitor (IC50=8.33muM; Ki=36.33muM),
 while complete inhibition of CpGPI activity was not achieved. Ebselen could
 also inhibit the growth of C. parvum in vitro (EC50=165muM) at concentrations
 nontoxic to host cells, albeit with a relatively small in vitro safety window
 of 4.2 (cytotoxicity TC50 on HCT-8cells=700muM). Additionally, ebselen might
 also target other enzymes in the parasite, leading to the parasite growth
 reduction. Therefore, although ebselen is useful in studying the inhibition
 of CpGPI enzyme activity, further proof is needed to chemically and/or
 genetically validate CpGPI as a drug target.",

    abstract "We previously engineered Escherichia coli to overproduce medium-
 to long-chain saturated and monounsaturated methyl ketones, which could
 potentially be applied as diesel fuel blending agents or in the flavor and
 fragrance industry. Recent efforts at strain optimization have focused on
 cofactor balance, as fatty acid-derived pathways face the systematic
 metabolic challenge of net NADPH consumption (in large part, resulting from
 the key fatty acid biosynthetic enzyme FabG [beta-ketoacyl-ACP reductase])
 and net NADH production. In this study, we attempted to mitigate cofactor
 imbalance by heterologously expressing NADH-dependent, rather than
 NADPH-dependent, versions of FabG identified in previous studies. Of the four
 NADH-dependent versions of FabG tested in our previously best-reported methyl
 ketone-producing strain (EGS1895), the version from Acholeplasma laidlawii
 (Al_FabG) showed the greatest increase in methyl ketone yield in shake flasks
 (35-75% higher than for an RFP negative-control strain, depending on sugar
 loading). An improved strain (EGS2920) attained methyl ketone titers during
 fed-batch fermentation of 5.4 +/- 0.5 g/L, which were, on average, ca. 40%
 greater than those for the base strain (EGS1895) under fermentation
 conditions optimized in this study. Shotgun proteomic data for strains
 EGS2920 and EGS1895 during fed-batch fermentation were consistent with the
 goal of alleviating NADPH limitation through expression of Al_FabG. For
 example, relative to strain EGS1895, strain EGS2920 significantly upregulated
 glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (directing flux into glycolysis rather than the
 NADPH-producing pentose phosphate pathway) and downregulated MaeB (a NADP(+)
 -dependent malate dehydrogenase). Overall, the results suggest that
 heterologous expression of NADH-dependent FabG in E. coli may improve
 sustained production of fatty acid-derived renewable fuels and chemicals.",

    abstract "BACKGROUND: We previously developed an E. coli strain that
 overproduces medium-chain methyl ketones for potential use as diesel fuel
 blending agents or as flavors and fragrances. To date, the strain's
 performance has been optimized during growth with glucose. However,
 lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysates also contain a substantial portion of
 hemicellulose-derived xylose, which is typically the second most abundant
 sugar after glucose. Commercialization of the methyl ketone-producing
 technology would benefit from the increased efficiency resulting from
 simultaneous, rather than the native sequential (diauxic), utilization of
 glucose and xylose. RESULTS: In this study, genetic manipulations were
 performed to alleviate carbon catabolite repression in our most efficient
 methyl ketone-producing strain. A strain engineered for constitutive
 expression of xylF and xylA (involved in xylose transport and metabolism)
 showed synchronized glucose and xylose consumption rates. However, this newly
 acquired capability came at the expense of methyl ketone titer, which
 decreased fivefold. Further efforts were made to improve methyl ketone
 production in this strain, and we found that two strategies were effective at
 enhancing methyl ketone titer: (1) chromosomal deletion of pgi
 (glucose-6-phosphate isomerase) to increase intracellular NADPH supply and
 (2) downregulation of CRP (cAMP receptor protein) expression by replacement
 of the native RBS with an RBS chosen based upon mutant library screening
 results. Combining these strategies resulted in the most favorable overall
 phenotypes for simultaneous glucose-xylose consumption without compromising
 methyl ketone titer at both 1 and 2% total sugar concentrations in shake
 flasks. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrated a strategy for engineering
 simultaneous utilization of C6 and C5 sugars in E. coli without sacrificing
 production of fatty acid-derived compounds.",

    abstract "Research on cancer metabolism has recently re-surfaced as a
 major focal point in cancer field with a reprogrammed metabolism no longer
 being considered as a mere consequence of oncogenic transformation, but as a
 hallmark of cancer. Reprogramming metabolic pathways and nutrient sensing is
 an elaborate way by which cancer cells respond to high bioenergetic and
 anabolic demands during tumorigenesis. Thus, inhibiting specific metabolic
 pathways at defined steps should provide potent ways of arresting tumor
 growth. However, both animal models and clinical observations have revealed
 that this approach is seriously limited by an extraordinary cellular
 metabolic plasticity. The classical example of cancer metabolic reprogramming
 is the preference for aerobic glycolysis, or Warburg effect, where cancers
 increase their glycolytic flux and produce lactate regardless of the presence
 of the oxygen. This allows cancer cells to meet the metabolic requirements
 for high rates of proliferation. Here, we discuss the benefits and
 limitations of disrupting fermentative glycolysis for impeding tumor growth
 at three levels of the pathway: (i) an upstream block at the level of the
 glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), (ii) a downstream block at the level of
 lactate dehydrogenases (LDH, isoforms A and B), and (iii) the endpoint block
 preventing lactic acid export (MCT1/4). Using these examples of genetic
 disruption targeting glycolysis studied in our lab, we will discuss the
 responses of different cancer cell lines in terms of metabolic rewiring,
 growth arrest, and tumor escape and compare it with the broader literature.",

    abstract "The evolution of life from extreme hypoxic environments to an
 oxygen-rich atmosphere has progressively selected for successful metabolic,
 enzymatic and bioenergetic networks through which a myriad of organisms
 survive the most extreme environmental conditions. From the two lethal
 environments anoxia/high O2, cells have developed survival strategies through
 expression of the transcriptional factors ATF4, HIF1 and NRF2. Cancer cells
 largely exploit these factors to thrive and resist therapies. In this review,
 we report and discuss the potential therapeutic benefit of disrupting the
 major Myc/Hypoxia-induced metabolic pathway, also known as fermentative
 glycolysis or ""Warburg effect"", in aggressive cancer cell lines. With three
 examples of genetic disruption of this pathway: glucose-6-phosphate isomerase
 (GPI), lactate dehydrogenases (LDHA and B) and lactic acid transporters
 (MCT1, MCT4), we illuminate how cancer cells exploit metabolic plasticity to
 survive the metabolic and energetic blockade or arrest their growth. In this
 context of NRF2 contribution to OXPHOS re-activation we will show and discuss
 how, by disruption of the cystine transporter xCT (SLC7A11), we can exploit
 the acute lethal phospholipid peroxidation pathway to induce cancer cell
 death by 'ferroptosis'.",

    abstract "BACKGROUND: Silicon (Si) has been known to regulate plant
 growth; however, the underlying mechanisms of short-term exogenous Si
 application on the regulation of calcium (Ca) and nitrogen (N), endogenous
 phytohormones, and expression of essential proteins have been little
 understood. RESULTS: Exogenous Si application significantly increased Si
 content as compared to the control. Among Si treatments, 1.0 mM Si
 application showed increased phosphorus content as compared to other Si
 treatments (0.5, 2.0, and 4.0 mM). However, Ca accumulation was significantly
 reduced (1.8- to 2.0-fold) at the third-leaf stage in the control, whereas
 all Si treatments exhibited a dose-dependent increase in Ca as determined by
 radioisotope (45)Ca analysis. Similarly, the radioisotope (15)N for nitrogen
 localization and uptake showed a varying but reduced response (ranging from
 1.03-10.8%) to different Si concentrations as compared to (15)N application
 alone. Physiologically active endogenous gibberellin (GA1) was also
 significantly higher with exogenous Si (1.0 mM) as compared to GA20 and the
 control plants. A similar response was noted for endogenous jasmonic and
 salicylic acid synthesis in rice plants with Si application. Proteomic
 analysis revealed the activation of several essential proteins, such as Fe-S
 precursor protein, putative thioredoxin, Ser/Thr phosphatase,
 glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (G6P), and importin alpha-1b (Imp3), with Si
 application. Among the most-expressed proteins, confirmatory gene expression
 analysis for G6P and Imp3 showed a similar response to those of the Si
 treatments. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the current results suggest that
 short-term exogenous Si can significantly regulate rice plant physiology by
 influencing Ca, N, endogenous phytohormones, and proteins, and that 1.0 mM Si
 application is more beneficial to plants than higher concentrations.",

    abstract "Habitat choice is defined as a nonrandom distribution of
 genotypes in different microhabitats. Therefore, it could exert a great
 impact on the genetic variance of natural populations by promoting genetic
 divergence, local adaptation, and may even lead to sympatric speciation.
 Despite this potential role in micro- and macro-evolutionary processes, there
 is little empirical evidence that the various genotypes within a population
 may differ in habitat choice-related behaviors. Here, we tested whether
 habitat choice may have contributed to genetic divergence within a local
 population of the Mediterranean killifish Aphanius fasciatus, which emerged
 between groups inhabiting microhabitats with different oxygen concentrations
 during previous field studies. In a first experiment, we studied the
 distribution of individuals in conditions of hypoxia and normoxia to test
 whether they had a different ability to shy away from a hypoxic environment;
 in a second experiment, we analyzed the individual behavior of fish
 separately in the two conditions, to verify whether they showed peculiar
 behavioral responses linked to a possible differential distribution. We then
 analyzed the six allozyme loci, whose allelic and genotypic frequencies were
 significantly divergent in the previous studies. In the first test, we found
 that the distribution of the two homozygote genotypes of the
 glucose-6-phosphate isomerase-1 locus (GPI-1) was significantly different
 between the hypoxic and the normoxic conditions. During the second test, all
 individuals were more active in hypoxic conditions, but the two GPI-1
 homozygotes showed a significant difference in time spent performing surface
 breathing, which was consistent with their distribution observed in the first
 experiment. These results provide evidence that individual behavioral traits,
 related to genetic features, may lead to a nonrandom distribution of
 genotypes in heterogeneous although contiguous microhabitats and,
 consequently, that habitat choice can play a significant role in driving the
 micro-evolutionary dynamics of this species.",

    abstract "We have studied the effect of hypoxia on the expression level of
 mRNA of the basic enzymes of pentose-phosphate cycle (G6PD, TKT, TALDO1, PGLS
 and RPIA) and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) in U87 glioma cells in
 relation to inhibition of IRE1 (inositol requiring enzyme 1). It was shown
 that hypoxia leads to up-regulation of the expression of GPI and PGLS genes
 and to down-regulation of TALDO1 and RPIA genes in control glioma cells.
 Changes for GPI gene were more significant than for other genes. At the same
 time, inhibition of IRE1 modified the effect of hypoxia on the expression of
 all studied genes. In particular, it increased sensitivity to hypoxia of G6PD
 and TKT genes expression and suppressed the effect of hypoxia on the
 expression of GPI and RPIA genes. Additionally, inhibition of IRE1 eliminated
 hypoxic regulation of PGLS gene and did not change significantly effect of
 hypoxia on the expression of TALDO1 gene in glioma cells. Present study
 demonstrated that hypoxia, which often contributes to tumor growth, affects
 the expression of most studied genes and inhibition of IRE1 modified the
 hypoxic regulation of pentose-phosphate cycle gene expressions in a gene
 specific manner and thus possibly contributes to slower glioma growth, but
 several aspects of this regulation warrant further investigation.",

    abstract "Cancer, the main cause of human deaths in the modern world is a
 group of diseases. Anticancer drug discovery is a challenge for scientists
 because of involvement of multiple survival pathways of cancer cells. An
 extensive study on the regulation of each step of these pathways may help
 find a potential cancer target. Up-regulated HIF-1 expression and altered
 metabolic pathways are two classical characteristics of cancer.
 Oxygen-dependent (through pVHL, PHDs, calcium-mediated) and independent
 (through growth factor signaling pathway, mdm2 pathway, HSP90) regulation of
 HIF-1alpha leads to angiogenesis, metastasis, and cell survival. The two
 subunits of HIF-1 regulates in the same fashion through different mechanisms.
 HIF-1alpha translation upregulates via mammalian target of rapamycin and
 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways, whereas HIF-1beta
 through calmodulin kinase. Further, the stabilized interactions of these two
 subunits are important for proper functioning. Also, metabolic pathways
 crucial for the formation of building blocks (pentose phosphate pathway) and
 energy generation (glycolysis, TCA cycle and catabolism of glutamine) are
 altered in cancer cells to protect them from oxidative stress and to meet the
 reduced oxygen and nutrient supply. Up-regulated anaerobic metabolism occurs
 through enhanced expression of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase,
 triosephosphate isomerase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and
 down-regulation of aerobic metabolism via pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase and
 lactate dehydrogenase which compensate energy requirements along with high
 glucose intake. Controlled expression of these two pathways through their
 common intermediate may serve as potent cancer target in future.",

    abstract "As Otto Warburg first observed, cancer cells largely favor
 fermentative glycolysis for growth even under aerobic conditions. This energy
 paradox also extends to rapidly growing normal cells indicating that
 glycolysis is optimal for fast growth and biomass production. Here we further
 explored this concept by genetic ablation of fermentative glycolysis in two
 fast growing cancer cell lines: human colon adenocarcinoma LS174T and B16
 mouse melanoma. We disrupted the upstream glycolytic enzyme,
 glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), to allow cells to re-route
 glucose-6-phosphate flux into the pentose-phosphate branch. Indeed, GPI-KO
 severely reduced glucose consumption and suppressed lactic acid secretion,
 which reprogrammed these cells to rely on oxidative phosphorylation and
 mitochondrial ATP production to maintain viability. In contrast to previous
 pharmacological inhibition of glycolysis that suppressed tumor growth, GPI-KO
 surprisingly demonstrated only a moderate impact on normoxic cell growth.
 However, hypoxic (1% O2) cell growth was severely restricted. Despite in
 vitro growth restriction under hypoxia, tumor growth rates in vivo were
 reduced less than 2-fold for both GPI-KO cancer cell lines. Combined our
 results indicate that exclusive use of oxidative metabolism has the capacity
 to provide metabolic precursors for biomass synthesis and fast growth. This
 work and others clearly indicate that metabolic cancer cell plasticity poses
 a strong limitation to anticancer strategies.",

    abstract "We investigated the role of mitochondrial function in the
 invasiveness of human colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines, using paired
 primary SW480 and metastatic SW620 cells, and appraised the clinical
 relevance of the alteration of mtDNA copy number in 33 pairs of CRC specimens
 after surgical resection. Suppression of mitochondrial function was achieved
 by the exposure of cells to oligomycin A (OA) or by knockdown of
 mitochondrial transcriptional factor A (TFAM) to evaluate their effects on
 energy metabolism, reactive oxygen species, protein expression levels of
 epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and invasive activity of CRC
 cells. We found that SW620 cells expressed higher levels of TFAM and
 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6 (ND6) and
 cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COX-II) and nuclear DNA-encoded NADH
 ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A9 (NDUFA9), iron-sulfur protein subunit B
 of succinate dehydrogenase (SDHB), ubiquinolcytochrome c reductase core
 protein I/II (UQCRC1/2) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COX-IV) when
 compared with the SW480 cells. The mtDNA copy number, ADP-triggered oxygen
 consumption rate (OCR) and respiratory control ratio (RCR) of
 succinate-supported respiration in the SW620 cells were higher than those
 noted in the SW480 cells. The intracellular levels of H2O2 and O2-* in the
 SW620 cells were lower than levels noted in the SW480 cells. Moreover, SW620
 cells displayed lower protein levels of hexokinase II (HK-II), glucose
 6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and lower
 lactate production rate, and expressed higher levels of EMT markers
 N-cadherin, vimentin and Snail, and showed higher Transwell migration and
 invasion activities as compared with the SW480 cells. After OA treatment,
 SW620 cells exhibited a decrease in OCR and RCR of succinate-supported
 respiration, an increase in lactate production rate and intracellular levels
 of H2O2 and O2-*. Moreover, the level of vimentin and Transwell migration
 activity of the SW620 cells were decreased. After TFAM knockdown, the protein
 levels of TFAM, ND6 and COX-II, and mtDNA copy number, OCR and RCR of
 succinate-supported respiration in the SW620-KD#4 and SW620-KD#5 cells were
 all lower than those noted in the SW620Control cells. By contrast, the
 protein level of HK-II, lactate production rate, the intracellular levels of
 H2O2 and O2-* in the SW620-KD#4 and SW620-KD#5 cells were all higher than
 those noted in the SW620-Control cells. Subsequently, both SW620-KD#4 and
 SW620-KD#5 cells had lower Transwell invasion activity than did the
 SW620-Control cells. Furthermore, we found that deeper invasion (P=0.025) and
 longer tumor length (P=0.069) were associated with higher mtDNA copy ratios
 in the 33 pairs of CRC specimens obtained from surgical resection. Taken
 together, we conclude that higher mtDNA copy number and mitochondrial
 function may confer an invasive advantage to CRCs.",

    abstract "APCs are known to produce NADPH oxidase (NOX) 2-derived reactive
 oxygen species; however, whether and how NOX2-mediated oxidation affects
 redox-sensitive immunogenic peptides remains elusive. In this study, we
 investigated a major immunogenic peptide in glucose-6-phosphate isomerase
 (G6PI), a potential autoantigen in rheumatoid arthritis, which can form
 internal disulfide bonds. Ag presentation assays showed that presentation of
 this G6PI peptide was more efficient in NOX2-deficient (Ncf1(m1J/m1J) mutant)
 mice, compared with wild-type controls. IFN-gamma-inducible lysosomal thiol
 reductase (GILT), which facilitates disulfide bond-containing Ag processing,
 was found to be upregulated in macrophages from Ncf1 mutant mice. Ncf1 mutant
 mice exhibited more severe G6PI peptide-induced arthritis, which was
 accompanied by the increased GILT expression in macrophages and enhanced
 Ag-specific T cell responses. Our results show that NOX2-dependent processing
 of the redox-sensitive autoantigens by APCs modify T cell activity and
 development of autoimmune arthritis.",

    abstract "KEY MESSAGE: Bioactive peptide was produced by fusion to rice
 prolamins in transgenic rice seeds. Their accumulation levels were affected
 by their deposition sites and by compensatory rebalancing between prolamins
 within PB-Is. Peptide immunotherapy using analogue peptide ligands (APLs) is
 one of promising treatments against autoimmune diseases. Use of seed storage
 protein as a fusion carrier is reasonable strategy for production of such
 small size bioactive peptides. In this study, to examine the efficacy of
 various rice prolamins deposited in ER-derived protein bodies (PB-Is), the
 APL12 from the Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI325-339) was expressed by
 fusion to four types of representative prolamins under the control of the
 individual native promoters. When the 14 and 16 kDa Cys-rich prolamins, which
 were localized in middle layer of PB-Is, were used for production of the
 APL12, they highly accumulated in transgenic rice seeds (~ 200 microg/grain).
 By contrast, fusion to the 10 and 13 kDa prolamins, which were localized in
 the core and outermost layer of PB-Is, resulted in lower levels of
 accumulation (~ 40 microg/grain). These results suggest that accumulation
 levels were highly affected by their deposition sites. Next, when different
 prolamin/APL12 fusion proteins were co-expressed to increase accumulation
 levels, they could not be increased so much as their expected additive
 levels. High accumulation of one type prolamin/APL12 led to reduction of
 other type(s) prolamin/APL12 to maintain the limited amounts of prolamins
 that can be deposited in PB-Is. Moreover, suppression of endogenous seed
 proteins by RNA interference also did not significantly enhance the
 accumulation levels of prolamin/APL12. These findings suggest that there may
 be compensatory rebalancing mechanism that controls the accumulation levels
 of prolamins deposited within PB-Is.",

    abstract "BACKGROUND: The DNA barcoding system using the cytochrome c
 oxidase subunit 1 mitochondrial gene (cox1 or COI) is highly efficient for
 discriminating vertebrate and invertebrate species. In the present study, we
 examined the suitability of cox1 as a marker for Trypanosoma cruzi
 identification from other closely related species. Additionally, we combined
 the sequences of cox1 and the nuclear gene glucose-6-phosphate isomerase
 (GPI) to evaluate the occurrence of mitochondrial introgression and the
 presence of hybrid genotypes. METHODS: Sixty-two isolates of Trypanosoma spp.
 obtained from five of the six Brazilian biomes (Amazon Forest, Atlantic
 Forest, Caatinga, Cerrado and Pantanal) were sequenced for cox1 and GPI gene
 fragments. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using neighbor-joining,
 maximum likelihood, parsimony and Bayesian inference methods. Molecular
 species delimitation was evaluated through pairwise intraspecific and
 interspecific distances, Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery, single-rate Poisson
 Tree Processes and multi-rate Poisson Tree Processes. RESULTS: Both cox1 and
 GPI genes recognized and differentiated T. cruzi, Trypanosoma cruzi
 marinkellei, Trypanosoma dionisii and Trypanosoma rangeli. Cox1 discriminated
 Tcbat, TcI, TcII, TcIII and TcIV. Additionally, TcV and TcVI were identified
 as a single group. Cox1 also demonstrated diversity in the discrete typing
 units (DTUs) TcI, TcII and TcIII and in T. c. marinkellei and T. rangeli.
 Cox1 and GPI demonstrated TcI and TcII as the most genetically distant
 branches, and the position of the other T. cruzi DTUs differed according to
 the molecular marker. The tree reconstructed with concatenated cox1 and GPI
 sequences confirmed the separation of the subgenus Trypanosoma
 (Schizotrypanum) sp. and the T. cruzi DTUs TcI, TcII, TcIII and TcIV. The
 evaluation of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was informative for DTU
 differentiation using both genes. In the cox1 analysis, one SNP
 differentiated heterozygous hybrids from TcIV sequences. In the GPI analysis
 one SNP discriminated Tcbat from TcI, while another SNP distinguished TcI
 from TcIII. CONCLUSIONS: DNA barcoding using the cox1 gene is a reliable tool
 to distinguish T. cruzi from T. c. marinkellei, T. dionisii and T. rangeli
 and identify the main T. cruzi genotypes.",

    abstract "The aim of the present study was to investigate the correlation
 between root respiration and the levels of biomass and glycyrrhizic acid in
 Glycyrrhiza uralensis. Root respiration was determined using a biological
 oxygen analyzer. Respiration-related enzymes including glucose-6-phosphate
 dehydrogenase plus 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, phosphohexose isomerase
 and succinate dehydrogenase, and respiratory pathways were evaluated. Biomass
 was determined by a drying-weighing method. In addition, the percentage of
 glycyrrhizic acid was detected using high-performance liquid chromatography.
 The association between root respiration and the levels of biomass and
 glycyrrhizic acid was investigated. The glycolysis pathway (EMP),
 tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and pentose phosphate (PPP) pathway acted
 concurrently in the roots of G. uralensis. Grey correlation analysis showed
 that TCA had the strongest correlation (correlation coefficient, 0.8003) with
 biomass. Starch and acetyl coenzyme A had the closest association with
 above-ground biomass, while soluble sugar correlated less strongly with
 above-ground biomass. Grey correlation analysis between biochemical pathways
 and the intermediates showed that pyruvic acid had the strongest correlation
 with EMP, while acetyl coenzyme A correlated most strongly with TCA. Among
 the intermediates and pathways, pyruvic acid and EMP exhibited the greatest
 correlation with glycyrrhizic acid, while acetyl coenzyme A and TCA
 correlated with glycyrrhizic acid less closely. The results of this study may
 aid the cultivation of G. uralensis. However, these results require
 verification in further studies.",

    abstract "BACKGROUND There have been few studies on the value of various
 antibody combinations in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnosis, and a lack of
 studies with large sample sizes, especially in the Chinese population. This
 study retrospectively evaluated the diagnostic value of a combined assay of
 five auto-antibodies [anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP),
 anti-keratin (AKA), anti-RA 33, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), and
 rheumatoid factor (RF)] for RA. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data were obtained from
 5,725 patients with rheumatic diseases in Southwest Hospital of Chongqing
 from 2011 to 2014. Detection of the five serological markers was performed
 for all study patients using the appropriate method for each antibody.
 RESULTS It was found that of the 5,725 patients, the positive rates for RF,
 anti-CCP, anti-RA 33, AKA, and GPI were 52.5%, 40.1%, 12.8%, 12.0%, and 50.0%
 respectively. In RA patients, the positive rates were 83.3%, 68.5%, 16.6%,
 20.8%, and 77.9% respectively, which were all significantly higher than those
 detected in patients with the other diseases (p<0.01). The areas under the
 receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve for RF, anti-CCP, anti-RA 33,
 AKA, and GPI were 0.857, 0.831, 0.528, 0.602, and 0.822 respectively,
 indicating that these five serological markers display favorable diagnostic
 value for RA. There were positive correlations between anti-CCP antibody and
 RF and GPI (p<0.01) and between RF and GPI (p<0.01), but no correlation
 between anti-RA 33 and AKA (p<0.01). The specificity of the combination of
 anti-CCP, AKA, and GPI was 100% for RA diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS The combined
 assay of serological markers significantly improved the diagnostic
 specificity for RA. The diagnostic value of RF for RA was the highest and the
 combined assay for anti-CCP, AKA, and GPI had the highest specificity for RA
 diagnosis.",

    abstract "Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), a well-known polyaromatic hydrocarbon,
 is known for its lung carcinogenicity, however, its role in bladder cancer
 development is still discussed. Comparative two-dimensional blue native
 SDS-PAGE analysis of protein complexes isolated from subcellular fractions of
 0.5 microM B[a]P-exposed cells indicated a differential regulation of
 proteins involved in carbohydrate, fatty acid, and nucleotide metabolism,
 suggesting a possible metabolic flux redistribution. It appeared that B[a]P
 exposure led to a repression of enzymes (fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A,
 glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, lactate dehydrogenase) involved in glycolysis,
 and an up-regulation of proteins (glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase,
 6-phosphogluconolactonase) catalyzing the pentose phosphate pathway and one
 carbon metabolism (10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, bifunctional
 purine biosynthesis protein). Untargeted metabolomics further supported the
 proteomic data, a lower concentration of glycolytic metabolite was observed
 as compared to glutamine, xylulose and fatty acids. The analysis of the
 glutathione and NADPH/NADP(+) content of the cells revealed a significant
 increase of these cofactors. Concomitantly, we did not observe any detectable
 increase in the production of ROS. With the present work, we shed light on an
 early phase of the metabolic stress response in which the urothelial cells
 are capable of counteracting oxidative stress by redirecting the metabolic
 flux from glycolysis to pentose phosphate pathway.",

    abstract "Actin as the main constitution of cytoskeleton in host cells
 plays an important role in mediating bacterial colonization. To identify the
 actin-binding proteins in Lactobacillus (L.) paracasei, L. plantarum, and L.
 brevis, actin immobilized to 24-well plate was used to probe adhesion
 proteins. Five adhesion proteins were identified and characterized by
 electrophoresis and LC-MS/MS: pyruvate kinase (PK), glucose-6-phosphate
 isomerase (PGI), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), chaperonin GroEL, and EF-Tu,
 all of which could display on the cell surface, indicating their possible
 role in mediating bacterial adhesion to host. This is in accordance with
 previous studies, which reported that these five proteins participated in and
 promoted the adhesion of pathogen or lactic acid bacteria to host. Moreover,
 PGK-actin binding domain analysis reveals that lysine (K) at amino acid
 position 127 in PGK might play a key role in mediating bacterial attachment
 to actin.",

 disorder responsible for chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, is the
 second most common red blood cell glycolytic enzymopathy. We report three
 patients from two unrelated families of Czech and Slovak origin with
 macrocytic hemolytic anemia due to GPI deficiency. The first patient had 15%
 of residual GPI activity resulting from two new heterozygous missense
 mutations c.478T>C and c.1414C>T leading to substitutions p.(Ser160Pro) and
 p.(Arg472Cys). Two other patients (siblings) inherited the same c.1414C>T
 p.(Arg472Cys) mutation in a homozygous constitution and lost approximately
 89% of their GPI activity. Erythroid hyperplasia with dysplastic features was
 observed in the bone marrow of all three patients. Low hepcidin/ferritin
 ratio and elevated soluble transferrin receptor detected in our GPI-deficient
 patients suggest disturbed balance between erythropoiesis and iron metabolism
 contributing to iron overload.",

    abstract "OBJECTIVE: To characterize the proteome profile of women with
 threatened preterm labor (PTL) below 34;0 weeks with and without microbial
 invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC) using mass spectrometry in the
 amniotic fluid (AF) and Western blot analysis in the cervical mucus and the
 vaginal fluid. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In the discovery phase, a case-control
 study including 8 women with MIAC and 7 without matched for gestational age
 at sampling was performed. Proteomic profile characterization was done using
 the LTQ VELOS Orbitrap mass spectrometer in the AF. In the validation phase,
 a selection of the proteins differentially expressed by mass spectrometry in
 the genital samples of a prospective cohort of 109 women was validated by
 Western blot analysis. RESULTS: In the discovery phase, the mass spectrometry
 analysis identified a total of 444 proteins. Sixteen were chosen for
 validation, being involved in defense (calgranulin A, B, C, C-reactive
 protein), cytoskeletal remodeling (alpha-actinin-4 [ACTN-4], plastin-2,
 alpha2-antiplasmin, vitronectin), metabolism (cystatin-beta, glucose 6
 phosphate isomerase, glutathione S-transferase, prostaglandin D2 synthase,
 corticosteroid-binding globulin), and vascular (alpha1-antichymotrypsin,
 hemopexin, endosialin) pathways. In the validation phase, cervical ACTN-4 was
 the only significantly upregulated protein in women with MIAC with an odds
 ratio of 6.8 (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Cervical ACTN-4 was significantly
 upregulated in the group of women with PTL with MIAC.",

    abstract "Ischemic injury in the heart is associated with death of
 cardiomyocytes and even after decades of research there is no appropriate
 therapeutic intervention to treat ischemic injury. The microRNA miR-34a is
 known to be induced in cardiomyocytes following ischemic injury. Another
 hallmark of ischemic injury is impaired glycolysis. The objective of the
 current study was to investigate the effects of short- and long-term exposure
 to hypoxia on miR-34a expression on apoptosis and regulation of key
 glycolysis metabolic enzymes. Both repeated short-term (30 min) burst of
 hypoxia with intermittent reoxygenation (30 min) as well as long-term (4 h)
 exposure to hypoxia followed by 6 h of reoxygenation robustly induced miR-34a
 levels. Hypoxia induced changes in cardiac permeability and localization of
 the channel protein connexin 34 as well as induced apoptosis as evident by
 levels of cleaved-caspase 3/7 and impaired cell proliferation. Hypoxia was
 also associated with decreased expression of key glycolytic enzymes
 hexokinase-1, hexokinase-2, glucose-6-phosphate-isomerase, and pyruvate
 dehydrogenase kinase 1. Attenuation of hypoxia-induced miR-34a by
 anti-miR-34a antagomir, but not a control antagomir, decreased miR-34a levels
 to those observed under normoxia and also inhibited apoptosis, potentially by
 rescuing expression of the key glycolytic enzymes. Cumulatively, our results
 establish that therapeutic targeting of miR-34a via antagomir might be a
 potent therapeutic mechanism to treat ischemic injury in the heart.",

 food components released during the simulated human digestion of a coffee
 fibre-containing biscuit (CFB) on alpha-glucosidase activity, antioxidant
 capacity and satiety hormones. Digest of CFB presented a significantly (p <
 0.05) lower amount of sugar (68.6 mg/g) and a higher antioxidant capacity
 (15.1 mg chlorogenic acid eq./g) than that of a sucrose-containing biscuit
 (SCB). The CFB significantly reduced (p < 0.05) alpha-glucosidase activity
 (IC50 = 3.3 mg/mL) compared to the SCB (IC50 = 6.2 mg/mL). Serotonin and
 glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) release by differentiated Caco-2 and HuTu-80
 cells, respectively, was stimulated by the CFB (355% at a concentration of
 0.5 mg/mL and 278% at a concentration of 0.05 mg/mL) to the same order of
 magnitude as those of the SCB. To summarize, the CFB was demonstrated to
 reduce monosaccharide bioaccessibility, to inhibit a diabetes-related
 digestive enzyme, and to improve the release of satiety hormones.",

    abstract "Escherichia coli lacking the glucose phosphotransferase system
 (PTS), mannose PTS and glucokinase are supposedly unable to grow on glucose
 as the sole carbon source (Curtis SJ, Epstein W. J Bacteriol
 1975;122:1189-1199). We report that W ptsG manZ glk (ALS1406) grows slowly on
 glucose in media containing glucose with a second carbon source: ALS1406
 metabolizes glucose after that other carbon source, including arabinose,
 fructose, glycerol, succinate or xylose, is exhausted. Galactose is an
 exception to this rule, as ALS1406 simultaneously consumes both galactose and
 glucose. The ability of ALS1406 to metabolize glucose in a xylose-glucose
 mixture was unchanged by an additional knockout in any single gene involved
 in carbohydrate transport and utilization, including agp (periplasmic
 glucose-1-phosphatase), galP (galactose permease), xylA (xylose isomerase),
 alsK (allose kinase), crr (glucose PTS enzyme IIA), galK (galactose kinase),
 mak (mannokinase), malE (maltose transporter), malX (maltose PTS enzyme
 IIBC), mglB (methyl-galactose transporter subunit), nagE (N-acetyl
 glucosamine PTS enzyme IICBA), nanK (N-acetyl mannosamine kinase) or pgm
 (phosphoglucose mutase). Glucose metabolism was only blocked by the deletion
 of two metabolic genes, pgi (phosphoglucose isomerase) and zwf
 (glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase), which prevents the entry of
 glucose-6-phosphate into the pentose phosphate and Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas
 pathways. Carbon-limited steady-state studies demonstrated that xylose must
 be sub-saturating for glucose to be metabolized, while nitrogen-limited
 studies showed that xylose is partly converted to glucose when xylose is in
 excess. Under transient conditions, ALS1406 converts almost 25 % (mass)
 xylose into glucose as a result of reversible transketolase and transaldolase
 and the re-entry of carbon into the pentose phosphate pathway via
 glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase.",

    abstract "Fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP) is a widely used medicine and is
 also a precursor of two important three-carbon phosphates - glyceraldehyde
 3-phosphate (GA3P) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) for the biosynthesis
 of numerous fine chemicals. An in vitro synthetic cofactor-free enzymatic
 pathway comprised of four hyperthermophilic enzymes was designed to produce
 FDP from starch and pyrophosphate. All of four hyperthermophilic enzymes
 (i.e., alpha-glucan phosphorylase from Thermotaga maritima,
 phosphoglucomutase from Thermococcus kodakarensis, glucose 6-phosphate
 isomerase from Thermus thermophilus, and pyrophosphate phosphofructokinase
 from T. maritima) were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified by
 simple heat precipitation. The optimal pH and temperature of one-pot
 biosynthesis were 7.2 and 70 degrees C, respectively. The optimal enzyme
 ratios of alphaGP, PGM, PGI and PFK were 2:2:1:2 in terms of units. Via
 step-wise addition of new substrates, up to 125 +/- 4.6mM FDP was synthesized
 after 7-h reaction. This de novo ATP-free enzymatic pathway comprised of all
 hyperthermophilic enzymes could drastically decrease the manufacturing costs
 of FDP and its derivatives GA3P and DHAP, better than those catalyzed by
 ATP-regeneration cascade biocatalysis, the use of mesophilic enzymes, whole
 cell lysates, and microbial cell factories.",

    abstract "Deficiencies in erythrocyte metabolic enzymes are associated
 with hereditary hemolytic anemia. Here, we report the development of a novel
 multiplex enzyme assay for six major enzymes, namely glucose-6-phosphate
 dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase, hexokinase,
 triosephosphate isomerase, and adenosine deaminase, deficiencies in which are
 implicated in erythrocyte enzymopathies. To overcome the drawbacks of
 traditional spectrophotometric enzyme assays, the present assay was based on
 ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
 (UPLC-MS/MS). The products of the six enzymes were directly measured by using
 ion pairing UPLC-MS/MS, and the precision, linearity, ion suppression,
 optimal sample amounts, and incubation times were evaluated. Eighty-three
 normal individuals and 13 patients with suspected enzymopathy were analyzed.
 The UPLC running time was within 5min. No ion suppression was observed at the
 retention time for the products or internal standards. We selected an optimal
 dilution factor and incubation time for each enzyme system. The intra- and
 inter-assay imprecision values (CVs) were 2.5-12.1% and 2.9-14.3%,
 respectively. The linearity of each system was good, with R(2) values >0.97.
 Patient samples showed consistently lower enzyme activities than those from
 normal individuals. The present ion paring UPLC-MS/MS assay enables facile
 and reproducible multiplex evaluation of the activity of enzymes implicated
 in enzymopathy-associated hemolytic anemia.",

    abstract "The focus of this study was the mechanism of starch accumulation
 in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii high-starch mutants. Three C. reinhardtii
 mutants showing high-starch content were generated using gamma irradiation.
 When grown under nitrogen-deficient conditions, these mutants had more than
 twice as much starch than a wild-type control. The mechanism of starch
 over-accumulation in these mutants was studied with comparative transcriptome
 analysis. In all mutants, induction of phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1) expression
 was detected; PGM1 catalyzes the inter-conversion of glucose 1-phosphate and
 glucose 6-phosphate in both starch biosynthetic and glycolytic pathway.
 Interestingly, transcript levels of phosphoglucose isomerase 1 (PGI1),
 fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase 1 and 2 (FBA1 and FBA2) were
 down-regulated in all mutants; PGI1, FBA1, and FBA2 act on downstream of
 glucose 6-phosphate conversion in glycolytic pathway. Therefore,
 down-regulations of PGI1, FBA1, and FBA2 may lead to accumulation of upstream
 metabolites, notably glucose 6-phosphate, resulting in induction of PGM1
 expression through feed-forward regulation and that PGM1 overexpression
 caused starch over-accumulation in mutants. These results suggest that PGI1,
 FBA1, FBA2, and PGM1 correlate with each other in terms of coordinated
 transcriptional regulation and play central roles for starch
 over-accumulation in C. reinhardtii.",

    abstract "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects and mechanisms of
 transgenic rice seeds expressing the altered peptide ligand (APL) of human
 glucose-6-phosphate-isomerase (hGPI325-339) in mice model of GPI induced
 arthritis (GIA). METHODS: We generated transgenic rice expressing APL12 which
 was analog peptide of hGPI325-339. The transgenic rice seeds were orally
 administered prophylactically before the induction of GIA. The severity of
 arthritis and titers of serum anti-GPI antibodies were evaluated. We examined
 IL-17 production from splenocytes and inguinal lymph node (iLN) and
 mesenteric lymph nodes (mLN) cells and analyzed the expression levels of
 functional molecules from splenocytes and iLN cells. RESULTS: Prophylactic
 treatment of GIA mice with APL12 transgenic rice seeds (APL12-TG)
 significantly improved the severity of arthritis, histopathological arthritis
 scores, and decreased titers of serum anti-GPI antibodies, BAFF mRNA in iLN
 cells, IL-17 production in splenocytes and iLN cells compared with
 non-transgenic rice-treated mice. APL12-TG-treated GIA mice showed
 upregulation of Foxp3 and GITR protein in CD4(+)CD25(+) cells in the spleen.
 CONCLUSION: APL12-TG improved the severity of GIA through a decrease in
 production of IL-17 and anti-GPI antibodies via upregulation of Foxp3 and
 GITR expression on regulatory T cells in spleen.",

    abstract "BACKGROUND: Phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI, EC 5.3.1.9) is an
 essential metabolic enzyme in all eukaryotes. An earlier study of the PgiC1
 gene, which encodes cytosolic PGI in the grass Festuca ovina L., revealed a
 marked difference in the levels of nucleotide polymorphism between the 5' and
 3' portions of the gene. METHODS: In the present study, we characterized the
 sequence polymorphism in F. ovina PgiC1 in more detail and examined possible
 explanations for the non-uniform pattern of nucleotide polymorphism across
 the gene. RESULTS: Our study confirms that the two portions of the PgiC1 gene
 show substantially different levels of DNA polymorphism and also suggests
 that the peptide encoded by the 3' portion of PgiC1 is functionally and
 structurally more important than that encoded by the 5' portion. Although
 there was some evidence of purifying selection (dN/dS test) on the 5' portion
 of the gene, the signature of purifying selection was considerably stronger
 on the 3' portion of the gene (dN/dS and McDonald-Kreitman tests). Several
 tests support the action of balancing selection within the 5' portion of the
 gene. Wall's B and Q tests were significant only for the 5' portion of the
 gene. There were also marked peaks of nucleotide diversity, Tajima's D and
 the dN/dS ratio at or around a PgiC1 codon site (within the 5' portion of the
 gene) that a previous study had suggested was subject to positive
 diversifying selection. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the two
 portions of the gene have been subject to different selective regimes.
 Purifying selection appears to have been the main force contributing to the
 relatively low level of polymorphism within the 3' portion of the sequence.
 In contrast, it is possible that balancing selection has contributed to the
 maintenance of the polymorphism within the 5' portion of the gene.",

    abstract "Protozoan viruses may influence the function and pathogenicity
 of the protozoa. Trichomonas vaginalis is a parasitic protozoan that could
 contain a double stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus, T. vaginalis virus (TVV).
 However, there are few reports on the properties of the virus. To further
 determine variations in protein expression of T. vaginalis, we detected 2
 strains of T. vaginalis; the virus-infected (V(+)) and uninfected (V(-))
 isolates to examine differentially expressed proteins upon TVV infection.
 Using a stable isotope N-terminal labeling strategy (iTRAQ) on soluble
 fractions to analyze proteomes, we identified 293 proteins, of which 50 were
 altered in V(+) compared with V(-) isolates. The results showed that the
 expression of 29 proteins was increased, and 21 proteins decreased in V(+)
 isolates. These differentially expressed proteins can be classified into 4
 categories: ribosomal proteins, metabolic enzymes, heat shock proteins, and
 putative uncharacterized proteins. Quantitative PCR was used to detect 4
 metabolic processes proteins: glycogen phosphorylase, malate dehydrogenase,
 triosephosphate isomerase, and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, which were
 differentially expressed in V(+) and V(-) isolates. Our findings suggest that
 mRNA levels of these genes were consistent with protein expression levels.
 This study was the first which analyzed protein expression variations upon
 TVV infection. These observations will provide a basis for future studies
 concerning the possible roles of these proteins in host-parasite interactions.",

    abstract "Autocrine motility factor (AMF) is a tumor-secreted cytokine
 that stimulates tumor cell motility in vitro and metastasis in vivo. AMF
 could be detected in serum or urine of cancer patients with worse prognosis.
 Reported as a cancer biomarker, AMF secretion into body fluids might be
 closely related to metastases formation. In this study, a sensitive and
 specific carbohydrate-based electrochemical biosensor was designed for the
 detection and quantification of a protein model of AMF, namely phosphoglucose
 isomerase from rabbit muscle (RmPGI). Indeed, RmPGI displays high homology
 with AMF and has been shown to have AMF activity. The biosensor was
 constructed by covalent binding of the enzyme substrate d-fructose
 6-phosphate (F6P). Immobilization was achieved on a gold surface electrode
 following a bottom-up approach through an aminated surface obtained by
 electrochemical patterning of ethylene diamine and terminal amine
 polyethylene glycol chain to prevent non-specific interactions.
 Carbohydrate-protein interactions were quantified in a range of 10 fM to
 100nM. Complex formation was analyzed through monitoring of the redox couple
 Fe(2+)/Fe(3+) by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and square wave
 voltammetry. The F6P-biosensor demonstrates a detection limit of 6.6 fM and
 high selectivity when compared to other non-specific glycolytic proteins such
 as d-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Detection of protein in spiked plasma
 was demonstrated and accuracy of 95% is obtained compared to result obtained
 in PBS (phosphate buffered saline). F6P-biosensor is a very promising proof
 of concept required for the design of a carbohydrate-based electrochemical
 biosensor using the enzyme substrate as bioreceptor. Such biosensor could be
 generalized to detect other protein biomarkers of interest.",

    abstract "Cytosolic phosphoglucose isomerase (pgiC) is an enzyme essential
 to glycolysis found universally in eukaryotes, but broad understanding of
 variation in the gene coding for pgiC is lacking for ferns. We used a
 substantially expanded representation of the gene for Andean species of the
 fern genus Polystichum to characterize pgiC in ferns relative to angiosperms,
 insects, and an amoebozoan; assess the impact of selection versus neutral
 evolutionary processes on pgiC; and explore evolutionary relationships of
 selected Andean species. The dataset of complete sequences comprised nine
 accessions representing seven species and one hybrid from the Andes and Serra
 do Mar. The aligned sequences of the full data set comprised 3376 base pairs
 (70% of the entire gene) including 17 exons and 15 introns from two central
 areas of the gene. The exons are highly conserved relative to angiosperms and
 retain substantial homology to insect pgiC, but intron length and structure
 are unique to the ferns. Average intron size is similar to angiosperms;
 intron number and location in insects are unlike those of the plants we
 considered. The introns included an array of indels and, in intron 7, an
 extensive microsatellite array with potential utility in analyzing
 population-level histories. Bayesian and maximum-parsimony analysis of 129
 variable nucleotides in the Andean polystichums revealed that 59 (1.7% of the
 3376 total) were phylogenetically informative; most of these united sister
 accessions. The phylogenetic trees for the Andean polystichums were
 incongruent with previously published cpDNA trees for the same taxa, likely
 the result of rapid evolutionary change in the introns and contrasting
 stability in the exons. The exons code a total of seven amino-acid
 substitutions. Comparison of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions did
 not suggest that the pgiC gene is under selection in the Andes. Variation in
 pgiC including two additional accessions represented by incomplete sequences
 provided new insights into reticulate relationships among Andean taxa.",

    abstract "Posner-Schlossman syndrome (PSS) shares some clinical features
 with uveitis and open angle glaucoma. Cytokines and autoantibodies have been
 associated with uveitis and open angle glaucoma. However, the role of serum
 cytokines and autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of PSS remains unknown. This
 study aimed to evaluate the associations of type 1 T helper (Th1) and Th17
 related cytokines and autoantibodies with PSS. Peripheral blood serum samples
 were collected from 81 patients with PSS and 97 gender- and age-matched
 healthy blood donors. Th1 and Th17 related cytokines, including
 interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-12, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha),
 interferon- gamma (IFN-gamma), IL-6 and IL-17, and glucose-6-phosphate
 isomerase (GPI) were determined by double antibody sandwich ELISA.
 Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-keratin antibody (AKA) and anti-neutrophil
 cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) were detected by indirect immunofluorescence
 assay. Anti-cardiolipin antibody (ACA)-IgG, ACA-IgM, ACA-IgA, anti-double
 stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody
 (anti-CCP) were detected by indirect ELISA. Serum levels of IL-1beta, IL-12
 and IL-6 in PSS patients were significantly lower than those in controls (P <
 0.003), and these associations survived the Bonferroni correction (Pc <
 0.018). There was no significant difference in serum levels of TNF-alpha,
 IFN-gamma and IL-17 between the PSS and control groups (Pc > 0.12). Positive
 rate of serum anti-dsDNA in PSS patients was significantly higher than that
 in the control group (P = 0.002, Pc = 0.018), while positive rates of serum
 ANA, AKA, ANCA, ACA-IgG, ACA-IgM, ACA-IgA, GPI and anti-CCP in the PSS group
 were not significantly different from those in the control group (Pc > 0.09).
 These results suggest that anti-dsDNA may contribute to the pathogenesis of
 PSS, while Th1 and Th17 related cytokines and other autoantibodies may not be
 major contributors to PSS.",

    abstract "BACKGROUND: Biologically, hydrogen (H2) can be produced through
 dark fermentation and photofermentation. Dark fermentation is fast in rate
 and simple in reactor design, but H2 production yield is unsatisfactorily low
 as <4 mol H2/mol glucose. To address this challenge, simultaneous production
 of H2 and ethanol has been suggested. Co-production of ethanol and H2
 requires enhanced formation of NAD(P)H during catabolism of glucose, which
 can be accomplished by diversion of glycolytic flux from the
 Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway to the pentose-phosphate (PP) pathway in
 Escherichia coli. However, the disruption of pgi (phosphoglucose isomerase)
 for complete diversion of carbon flux to the PP pathway made E. coli unable
 to grow on glucose under anaerobic condition. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate
 that, when glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Zwf) and 6-phosphogluconate
 dehydrogenase (Gnd), two major enzymes of the PP pathway, are homologously
 overexpressed, E. coli Deltapgi can recover its anaerobic growth capability
 on glucose. Further, with additional deletions of DeltahycA, DeltahyaAB,
 DeltahybBC, DeltaldhA, and DeltafrdAB, the recombinant Deltapgi mutant could
 produce 1.69 mol H2 and 1.50 mol ethanol from 1 mol glucose. However, acetate
 was produced at 0.18 mol mol(-1) glucose, indicating that some carbon is
 metabolized through the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway. To further improve the
 flux via the PP pathway, heterologous zwf and gnd from Leuconostoc
 mesenteroides and Gluconobacter oxydans, respectively, which are less
 inhibited by NADPH, were overexpressed. The new recombinant produced more
 ethanol at 1.62 mol mol(-1) glucose along with 1.74 mol H2 mol(-1) glucose,
 which are close to the theoretically maximal yields, 1.67 mol mol(-1) each
 for ethanol and H2. However, the attempt to delete the ED pathway in the
 Deltapgi mutant to operate the PP pathway as the sole glycolytic route, was
 unsuccessful. CONCLUSIONS: By deletion of pgi and overexpression of
 heterologous zwf and gnd in E. coli DeltahycA DeltahyaAB DeltahybBC DeltaldhA
 DeltafrdAB, two important biofuels, ethanol and H2, could be successfully
 co-produced at high yields close to their theoretical maximums. The strains
 developed in this study should be applicable for the production of other
 biofuels and biochemicals, which requires supply of excessive reducing power
 under anaerobic conditions.",

    abstract "Corynebacterium glutamicum is particularly known for its
 potentiality in succinate production. We engineered C. glutamicum for the
 production of succinate. To enhance C3-C4 carboxylation efficiency,
 chromosomal integration of the pyruvate carboxylase gene pyc resulted in
 strain NC-4. To increase intracellular NADH pools, the pntAB gene from
 Escherichia coli, encoding for transhydrogenase, was chromosomally integrated
 into NC-4, leading to strain NC-5. Furthermore, we deleted pgi gene in strain
 NC-5 to redirect carbon flux to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). To solve
 the drastic reduction of PTS-mediated glucose uptake, the ptsG gene from C.
 glutamicum, encoding for the glucose-specific transporter, was chromosomally
 integrated into pgi-deficient strain resulted in strain NC-6. In anaerobic
 batch fermentation, the production of succinate in pntAB-overexpressing
 strain NC-5 increased by 14% and a product yield of 1.22 mol/mol was
 obtained. In anaerobic fed-batch process, succinic acid concentration reached
 856 mM by NC-6. The yields of succinate from glucose were 1.37 mol/mol
 accompanied by a very low level of by-products. Activating PPP and
 transhydrogenase in combination led to a succinate yield of 1.37 mol/mol,
 suggesting that they exhibited a synergistic effect for improving succinate
 yield.",

    abstract "The use of animal models of arthritis is a key component in the
 evaluation of therapeutic strategies against the human disease rheumatoid
 arthritis (RA). Here we present quantitative measurements of bone degradation
 characterised by the cortical bone profile using glucose-6-phosphate
 isomerase (G6PI) induced arthritis. We applied micro-computed tomography
 (muCT) during three arthritis experiments and one control experiment to image
 the metatarsals of the hind paws and to investigate the effect of
 experimental arthritis on their cortical bone profile. For measurements of
 the cortical profile we automatically identified slices that are orthogonal
 to individual metatarsals, thereby making the measurements independent of
 animal placement in the scanner. We measured the average cortical thickness
 index (CTI) of the metatarsals, as well as the thickness changes along the
 metatarsal. In this study we introduced the cortical thickness gradient (CTG)
 as a new measure and we investigated how arthritis affects this measure. We
 found that in general both CTI and CTG are able to quantify arthritic
 progression, whilst CTG was found to be the more sensitive measure.",

    abstract "Upregulation of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway
 (PPP) is a major characteristic of the metabolic reprogramming of cancer and
 provides cancer cells with energy and vital metabolites to support their
 rapid proliferation. Targeting glycolysis and the PPP has emerged as a
 promising antitumor therapeutic strategy. Marine natural products are
 attractive sources for anticancer therapeutics, as evidenced by the antitumor
 drug Yondelis. Mycoepoxydiene (MED) is a natural product isolated from a
 marine fungus that has shown promising inhibitory efficacy against HeLa cells
 in vitro. We used a proteomic approach with two-dimensional gel
 electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled with mass spectrometry to explore the cellular
 targets of MED and to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the
 antitumor activity of MED in HeLa cells. Our proteomic data showed that
 triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) and 6-phosphogluconolactonase (PGLS), which
 participate in glycolysis and the PPP, respectively, were significantly
 downregulated by MED treatment. Functional studies revealed that the
 expression levels of several other enzymes involved in glycolysis and the
 PPP, including hexokinase 2 (HK2), phosphofructokinase 1 (PFKM), aldolase A
 (ALDOA), enolase 1 (ENO1), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), and
 glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), were also reduced in a
 dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the LDHA and G6PD enzymatic activities in
 HeLa cells were inhibited by MED, and overexpression of these downregulated
 enzymes rescued HeLa cells from the growth inhibition induced by MED. Our
 data suggest that MED suppresses HeLa cell growth by inhibiting glycolysis
 and the PPP, which provides a mechanistic basis for the development of new
 therapeutics against cervical cancer.",

    abstract "INTRODUCTION: Inherited anemias diagnostic workup requires a
 step-wise algorithm. Causal genes implicated in congenital hemolytic anemia
 are numerous, making a gene-by-gene approach by Sanger sequencing time
 consuming, expensive and labour intensive. Targeted resequencing can be of
 great use in explaining these cases. METHODOLOGY: Six months female presented
 with neonatal jaundice and negative family history. Clinical and laboratory
 evidences were suggestive of hemolytic anemia. G6PD deficiency, thalassemias,
 hemoglobinopathies, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hereditary spherocytosis and
 pyruvate kinase deficiency were excluded. Targeted resequencing on Illumina
 MiSeq using TruSight One sequencing panel was performed to identify the
 causative mutations. RESULTS: 35-40% of RBCs were acanthocytes and
 echinocytes. A missense homozygous mutation was found inglucose-6-phosphate
 isomerase, GPI [c.1040G>A (p.Arg347His), rs137853583] which results in
 nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. CONCLUSION: This study describes GPI
 p.Arg347His mutation for the first time from India and is the first report of
 red cell GPI deficiency diagnosed using NGS-based resequencing and highlights
 the potential of this technique in clinical practice.",

    abstract "Triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) is a vital enzyme in the
 glycolytic pathway, which can catalyze the interconversion of
 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). DHAP
 is involved in lipid metabolism and phospholipid synthesis. In order to know
 the role of TPI in WSSV infection to prawn, we cloned the full length cDNA of
 triosephosphate isomerase gene (EcTPI) from Exopalaemon carinicauda, and its
 function during WSSV infection was analyzed. EcTPI transcripts were widely
 distributed in all tissues, but showed relatively higher expression levels in
 the gill and epidermis. Its expression was apparently up-regulated after 24 h
 post WSSV injection (hpi), when the virus load began to rise. Furthermore, we
 detected the expressions of the key genes encoding the enzymes which catalyze
 the key steps in the glycolysis during WSSV infection. The data showed that
 genes encoding the enzymes which catalyzed upper steps of glycolysis to
 produce GAP, including hexokinase (HK), glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI)
 and phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), were significantly up-regulated at 24 and
 27 hpi. Genes encoding the enzymes catalyzing down steps of glycolysis after
 GAP, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), enolase
 (ENO) and pyruvate kinase (PK), were apparent down-regulated at 24 and 27
 hpi. Meanwhile, the gene encoding the enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate
 dehydrogenase (GPDH) catalyzing DHAP to glycerol-3-phosphate (G-3-P) showed
 down-regulation at 12-27 hpi, while the gene encoding
 dihydroxyacetone-phosphate acyltransferase (DHAPAT) catalyzing DHAP to
 further synthesis of phospholipids showed up-regulation at 12-24 hpi. These
 data suggested that WSSV infection could change the glycolysis pathway to
 make them produce more phospholipids which could be very helpful for virus
 replication. In order to further confirm the above speculation, dsRNA
 interference (RNAi) approach was used to knock down EcTPI gene and analyze
 its effect on WSSV load in prawn. The data showed that interference of EcTPI
 gene led to a significant decrease of WSSV loads in WSSV infected prawn.
 These data provided useful information to understand the infection mechanism
 of WSSV.",

    abstract "Flavonoids are plant-based polyphenolic biomolecules with a wide
 range of biological activities. Glycosylated flavonoids have drawn special
 attention in the industries as it improves solubility, stability, and
 bioactivity. Herein, we report the production of astilbin (ATN) from
 taxifolin (TFN) in genetically-engineered Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The
 exogenously supplied TFN was converted to ATN by 3-O-rhamnosylation utilizing
 the endogeneous TDP-L-rhamnose in presence of UDP-glycosyltransferase (ArGT3,
 Gene Bank accession number: At1g30530) from Arabidopsis thaliana. Upon
 improving the intracellular TDP-L-rhamnose pool by knocking out the
 chromosomal glucose phosphate isomerase (pgi) and D-glucose-6-phosphate
 dehydrogenase (zwf) deletion along with the overexpression of rhamnose
 biosynthetic pathway increases the biotransformation product, ATN with total
 conversion of ~49.5 +/- 1.67% from 100 microM of taxifolin. In addition, the
 cytotoxic effect of taxifolin-3-O-rhamnoside on PANC-1 and A-549 cancer cell
 lines was assessed for establishing ATN as potent antitumor compound.",

    abstract "Escherichia coli strains expressing the O-glucosyltransferases
 UGT73B3 or UGT84B1 were compared for the production of glucosides from
 quercetin supplied into a defined medium. The formation of
 quercetin-3-glucoside (Q3G) by UGT73B3 showed a maximum at 33  degrees C,
 while the formation of quercetin-7-glucoside by UGT84B1 increased with
 increasing temperature to 37  degrees C. The highest concentrations of Q3G
 were attained by strains having a deletion in the pgi gene-coding
 phosphoglucose isomerase, which effectively blocked the entry of glucose-6P
 into the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway. Formation of Q3G was improved in 1-L
 controlled bioreactors compared to shake flask cultures, a result attributed
 to the greater oxygen transfer rate in bioreactors. Under batch conditions
 with 30 g/L glucose as the sole carbon source, E. coli MEC367 (MG1655 pgi)
 expressing UGT73B3 generated 3.9 g/L Q3G in 56 h.",

    abstract "The higher level of Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (G6PI) has
 been found in both synovial tissue and synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis
 (RA) patients, while the function of G6PI in RA remains unclear. Herein we
 found the enrichment of G6PI in microvascular endothelial cells of synovial
 tissue in RA patients, where a 3% O2 hypoxia environment has been identified.
 In order to determine the correlation between the high G6PI level and the low
 oxygen concentration in RA, a hypoxia condition (~3% O2) in vitro was applied
 to mimic the RA environment in vivo. Hypoxia promoted cellular proliferation
 of rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs), and induced cell
 migration and angiogenic tube formation of human dermal microvascular
 endothelial cells (HDMECs), which were accompanied with the increased
 expression of G6PI and HIF-1alpha. Through application of G6PI
 loss-of-function assays, we confirmed the requirement of G6PI expression for
 those hypoxia-induced phenotype in RA. In addition, we demonstrated for the
 first time that G6PI plays key roles in regulating VEGF secretion from RASFs
 to regulate the hypoxia-induced angiogenesis in RA. Taken together, we
 demonstrated a novel pathway regulating hypoxia-induced angiogenesis in RA
 mediated by G6PI.",

    abstract "Male sex predisposes to many kidney diseases. Considering that
 androgens exert deleterious effects in a variety of cell types within the
 kidney, we hypothesized that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) would alter the
 biology of the renal tubular cell by inducing changes in the proteome. We
 employed stable isotope labeling with amino acids (SILAC) in an indirect
 spike-in fashion to accurately quantify the proteome in DHT- and
 17beta-estradiol (EST)-treated human proximal tubular epithelial cells
 (PTEC). Of the 5043 quantified proteins, 76 were differentially regulated.
 Biological processes related to energy metabolism were significantly enriched
 among DHT-regulated proteins. SILAC ratios of 3 candidates representing
 glycolysis, N-acetylglucosamine metabolism and fatty acid beta-oxidation,
 namely glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI),
 glucosamine-6-phosphate-N-acetyltransferase 1 (GNPNAT1), and mitochondrial
 trifunctional protein subunit alpha (HADHA), were verified in vitro. In vivo,
 renal GPI and HADHA protein expression was significantly increased in males.
 Furthermore, male sex was associated with significantly higher GPI, GNPNAT1,
 and HADHA kidney protein expression in two different murine models of
 diabetes. Enrichment analysis revealed a link between our DHT-regulated
 proteins and oxidative stress within the diabetic kidney. This finding was
 validated in vivo, as we observed increased oxidative stress levels in
 control and diabetic male kidneys, compared with females. This in depth
 quantitative proteomics study of human primary PTEC response to sex hormone
 administration suggests that male sex hormone stimulation results in
 perturbed energy metabolism in kidney cells, and that this perturbation
 results in increased oxidative stress in the renal cortex. The proteome-level
 changes associated with androgens may play a crucial role in the development
 of structural and functional changes in the diseased kidney. With our
 findings, we propose a possible link between diabetic and non-diabetic kidney
 disease progression and male sex hormone levels. Data are available via

    abstract "Soybean is highly sensitive to flooding stress and exhibits
 markedly reduced plant growth and grain yield under flooding conditions. To
 explore the mechanisms underlying initial flooding tolerance in soybean, RNA
 sequencing-based transcriptomic analysis was performed using a
 flooding-tolerant line and ABA-treated soybean. A total of 31 genes included
 12 genes that exhibited similar temporal patterns were commonly changed in
 these plant groups in response to flooding and they were mainly involved in
 RNA regulation and protein metabolism. The mRNA expression of matrix
 metalloproteinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, ATPase family AAA
 domain-containing protein 1, and cytochrome P450 77A1 was up-regulated in
 wild-type soybean under flooding conditions; however, no changes were
 detected in the flooding-tolerant line or ABA-treated soybean. The mRNA
 expression of cytochrome P450 77A1 was specifically up-regulated in root tips
 by flooding stress, but returned to the level found in control plants
 following treatment with the P450 inhibitor uniconazole. The survival ratio
 and root fresh weight of plants were markedly improved by 3-h uniconazole
 treatment under flooding stress. Taken together, these results suggest that
 cytochrome P450 77A1 is suppressed by uniconazole treatment and that this
 inhibition may enhance soybean tolerance to flooding stress.",

    abstract "OBJECTIVE: To explore the titer of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase
 (GPI) for early diagnosis of the outpatient with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in
 real life, and to analyze its relationship with disease activity. METHODS: In
 the study, 1 051 patients with arthritis were collected in the group who had
 joints tender and swelling, and 90 cases of healthy people as a control
 group. ELISA method was used to detect the serum level of GPI, and according
 to clinical features and laboratory test, all the patients including 525 RA
 patients, the other patients including osteoarthritis (OA), 134 cases of
 seronegative spine joint disease (SpA), 104 cases of systemic lupus
 erythematosus (SLE), 31 cases of primary Sjogren syndrome (pSS), 24 cases of
 gout arthritis (GA), 22 cases of other connective tissue diseases (including
 polymyalgia rheumatica, dermatomyositis, systemic sclerosis, adult Still
 disease) and 46 cases of other diseases (including 165 cases of osteoporosis,
 avascular necrosis of the femoral head, traumatic osteomyelitis, bone and
 joint disease, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, tumor). The diagnostic values
 of GPI were assessed, and the differences between the GPI positive and
 negative groups of the RA patients in clinical characteristics, disease
 activity, severity and inflammatory index analyzed. RESULTS: The positive
 rate of serum GPI in the patients with RA was 55.4%, contrasting to other
 autoimmune diseases (14.3%) and healthy controls (7.78%)(P<0.001). Compared
 with the OA and SpA patients, the RA group was increased more significantly,
 and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.001). The diagnostic
 value of GPI alone for RA was 0.39 mg/L, the sensitivity was 54.2%, and
 specificity was 87.3%. The positive rate of GPI in RF negative patients was
 36.1%; the positive rate of GPI in anti-CCP antibody negative patients was
 34.2%; the positive rate of GPI in RF and anti-CCP antibody negative patients
 was 24.1%. The level of GPI had positive correlation (P<0.05) with ESR, RF,
 anti-CCP antibody and HRF-IgG. CONCLUSION: GPI is sensitive in the patients
 with RA; GPI positive is important in the diagnosis of RA with anti-CCP
 antibody and/or RF negative patients. The titer of GPI is related with
 disease activity of RA.",

 anti-C-GPI(435-453) antibody, anti-GPI(70-88) antibody and anti-GPI(435-453)
 antibody were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 191 RA
 patients, 129 other rheumatic diseases and 74 healthy controls. The clinical
 and laboratory data of the patients with RA were collected, and the values of
 anti-C-GPI peptide antibodies in the diagnosis of RA and the relationships of
 anti-C-GPI peptide antibodies with the clinical and laboratory parameters
 analyzed. RESULTS: (1) The mean titers of the anti-C-GPI(70-88) antibody and
 the anti-C-GPI(435-453) antibody in the RA patients (respectively, 68.71  +/-
  4.20 and 51.78  +/-  3.13) were significantly higher than those with other
 rheumatic diseases and healthy individuals (P <0.05). However, the mean
 titers of the anti-GPI(70-88) antibody and anti-GPI(435-453) antibody in the
 RA patients were similar to those with other rheumatic diseases and healthy
 individuals. (2) The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the
 anti-C-GPI(70-88) antibody for RA were 41.88% and 84.50% respectively; and
 the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the anti-C-GPI(435-453)
 antibody for RA were 46.05% and 86.05% respectively. The sensitivity of
 combined detection of the two anti-C-GPI peptide antibodies was 50.79%, and
 the specificity was 81.40%. (3) The positive rates of the anti-C-GPI(70-88)
 antibody and the anti-C-GPI(435-453) antibody were 35% and 45% respectively
 in those patients with negative anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody,
 anti-keratin antibody, and rheumatoid factor. (4) There was no significant
 difference in clinical and laboratory indicators between the
 anti-C-GPI(70-88) antibody or anti-C-GPI(435-453) antibody positive group and
 negative group. CONCLUSION: The anti-C-GPI(70-88) antibody and
 anti-C-GPI(435-453) antibody can be detected in the serum of RA patients, and
 C-GPI may be involved in the pathogenesis of RA. There is a certain
 diagnostic significance for the sera-negative RA.",

    abstract "The genetic variability in three populations of Hypostomus
 hermanni from the tributaries of the rivers Ivai (Keller), Tiete
 (Piracicaba), and Sapucai (Sapucai-Mirim) was determined using
 electrophoresis on starch gel. The variability in the genes for eight
 enzymes, namely, aspartate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.1), glucose-6-phosphate
 isomerase (EC 5.3.1.9), glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.8),
 isocitrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.42), -lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27),
 malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37), malate dehydrogenase NADP+ (EC 1.1.1.40),
 and phosphoglucomutase (EC 5.4.2.2), was assessed. Three loci with seven
 alleles were obtained in the population of Keller River whereas eight loci
 with 20 alleles and six loci with 16 alleles were present in the populations
 of Piracicaba and Sapucai-Mirim rivers, respectively. Individuals analyzed in
 the three watersheds presented all the detected polymorphic loci. The average
 heterozygosity was 0.0527, 0.1742, and 0.1299 in the Keller, Piracicaba, and
 Sapucai-Mirim River populations, respectively. On the basis of identity
 values and genetic distances, all the three populations were determined to be
 genetically very similar.",

    abstract "The central carbon metabolism (glycolysis, the pentose phosphate
 pathway [PPP], and the tricarboxylic acid [TCA] cycle) plays an essential
 role in the supply of biosynthetic precursors and energy. How the central
 carbon metabolism changes with the varying growth rates in the in vitro
 cultivation of rapidly proliferating mammalian cells, such as cancer cells
 and continuous cell lines for recombinant protein production, remains
 elusive. Based on relationships between the growth rate and the activity of
 seven key enzymes from six cell clones, this work reports finding an
 important metabolic characteristic in rapidly proliferating glutamine
 synthetase-Chinese hamster ovary cells. The key enzymatic activity involved
 in the TCA cycle that is responsible for the supply of energy became elevated
 as the growth rate exhibited increases, while the activity of key enzymes in
 metabolic pathways (glycolysis and the PPP), responsible for the supply of
 biosynthetic precursors, tended to decrease-suggesting that rapidly
 proliferating cells still depended predominantly on the TCA cycle rather than
 on aerobic glycolysis for their energetic demands. Meanwhile, the
 growth-limiting resource was most likely biosynthetic substrates rather than
 energy provision. In addition, the multifaceted role of glucose-6-phosphate
 isomerase (PGI) was confirmed, based on a significant correlation between PGI
 activity and the percentage of G2/M-phase cells.",

    abstract "Volatile compounds (VCs) emitted by phylogenetically diverse
 microorganisms (including plant pathogens and microbes that do not normally
 interact mutualistically with plants) promote photosynthesis, growth, and the
 accumulation of high levels of starch in leaves through cytokinin
 (CK)-regulated processes. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants not
 exposed to VCs, plastidic phosphoglucose isomerase (pPGI) acts as an
 important determinant of photosynthesis and growth, likely as a consequence
 of its involvement in the synthesis of plastidic CKs in roots. Moreover, this
 enzyme plays an important role in connecting the Calvin-Benson cycle with the
 starch biosynthetic pathway in leaves. To elucidate the mechanisms involved
 in the responses of plants to microbial VCs and to investigate the extent of
 pPGI involvement, we characterized pPGI-null pgi1-2 Arabidopsis plants
 cultured in the presence or absence of VCs emitted by Alternaria alternata We
 found that volatile emissions from this fungal phytopathogen promote growth,
 photosynthesis, and the accumulation of plastidic CKs in pgi1-2 leaves.
 Notably, the mesophyll cells of pgi1-2 leaves accumulated exceptionally high
 levels of starch following VC exposure. Proteomic analyses revealed that VCs
 promote global changes in the expression of proteins involved in
 photosynthesis, starch metabolism, and growth that can account for the
 observed responses in pgi1-2 plants. The overall data show that Arabidopsis
 plants can respond to VCs emitted by phytopathogenic microorganisms by
 triggering pPGI-independent mechanisms.",

    abstract "INTRODUCTION: Combination treatment with fingolimod (FTY720)
 plus pathogenic antigen is thought to prevent glucose-6-phosphate isomerase
 (GPI)325-339-induced arthritis progression by effective induction of immune
 tolerance. Here, we examined the efficacy of this combination treatment on
 remission maintenance. METHODS: GPI325-339-induced arthritis mice were
 treated for 5 days with FTY720 (1.0 mg/kg, p.o.) alone, GPI325-339 (10
 mug/mouse, i.v.) alone, or with the FTY720 plus GPI325-339 combination. In
 some experiments, mice were resensitized with GPI325-339. RESULTS: Following
 resensitization with GPI325-339, combination-treated mice exhibited neither
 severe relapse nor elevated lymphocyte infiltration in joints. Neither
 anti-human nor mouse GPI325-339 antibody levels were correlated with clinical
 symptoms. This suggests that combination treatment prevents relapse following
 resensitization via regulation of pathogenic antigen-specific T cells. The
 proportion of regulatory T (Treg) cells in inguinal lymph nodes was increased
 post treatment in the FTY720 alone and FTY720 plus GPI325-339 groups. In
 contrast, the proportion of glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor
 receptor-family-related gene/protein (GITR)(+) non-Treg cells was increased
 only in combination-treated mice. Furthermore, GITR(+) non-Treg cells, which
 were induced by the combination treatment in vivo, possess suppressive
 activity and high ability to produce interleukin (IL)-10. CONCLUSION: GITR(+)
 non-Treg cells might play a key role in relapse prevention following
 resensitization. Thus, this combination treatment might establish immune
 tolerance by induction of GITR(+) non-Treg cells.",

    abstract "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of transgenic rice seeds
 expressing the altered peptide ligand (APL) of human
 glucose-6-phosphate-isomerase (hGPI325-339) in mice model of GPI-induced
 arthritis (GIA). METHODS: We generated transgenic rice expressing T-cell
 epitope of hGPI325-339 and APL12 contained in the seed endosperm. The
 transgenic rice seeds were orally administered prophylactically before the
 induction of GIA. The severity of arthritis and titers of serum anti-GPI
 antibodies were evaluated. We examined for IL-17 production in splenocytes
 and inguinal lymph node (iLN) cells, and analyzed the expression levels of
 functional molecules in splenocytes. RESULTS: Prophylactic treatment of GIA
 mice with APL12 transgenic (APL12-TG) rice seeds significantly reduced the
 severity of arthritis and titers of serum anti-GPI antibodies compared with
 non-transgenic (Non-TG) rice-treated mice. APL12-TG and hGPI325-339
 transgenic (hGPI325-339-TG) rice seeds improved the histopathological
 arthritis scores and decreased IL-17 production compared with non-TG
 rice-treated mice. APL12-TG rice-treated GIA mice showed upregulation of
 Foxp3 and GITR protein in CD4 (+) CD25 (+) Foxp3(+ )cells in the spleen
 compared with non-TG rice- and hGPI325-339-TG rice-treated mice. CONCLUSION:
 APL12-TG rice seeds improved the severity of GIA through a decrease in
 production of IL-17 and anti-GPI antibodies via upregulation of Foxp3 and
 GITR expression on Treg cells in spleen.",

    abstract "Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) deficiency cause hereditary
 nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (HNSHA) of variable severity in individuals
 homozygous or compound heterozygous for mutations in GPI gene. This work
 presents clinical features and genotypic results of two patients of
 Portuguese origin with GPI deficiency. The patients suffer from a mild
 hemolytic anemia (Hb levels ranging from 10 to 12.7g/mL) associated with
 macrocytosis, reticulocytosis, hyperbilirubinemia, hyperferritinemia and
 slight splenomegaly. Genomic DNA sequencing revealed in one patient
 homozygosity for a new missense mutation in exon 3, c.260G>C (p.Gly87Ala),
 and in the second patient compound heterozygosity for the same missense
 mutation (p.Gly87Ala), along with a frameshift mutation resulting from a
 single nucleotide deletion in exon 14, c.1238delA (p.Gln413Arg fs*24).
 Mutation p.Gln413Arg fs*24 is the first frameshift null mutation to be
 described in GPI deficiency. Molecular modeling suggests that the structural
 change induced by the p.Gly87Ala pathogenic variant has direct impact in the
 structural arrangement of the region close to the active site of the enzyme.",

    abstract "Calponin is an actin cytoskeleton-associated protein that
 regulates motility-based cellular functions. Three isoforms of calponin are
 present in vertebrates, among which calponin 2 encoded by the Cnn2 gene is
 expressed in multiple types of cells, including blood cells from the myeloid
 lineage. Our previous studies demonstrated that macrophages from Cnn2
 knockout (KO) mice exhibit increased migration and phagocytosis. Intrigued by
 an observation that monocytes and macrophages from patients with rheumatoid
 arthritis had increased calponin 2, we investigated anti-glucose-6-phosphate
 isomerase serum-induced arthritis in Cnn2-KO mice for the effect of calponin
 2 deletion on the pathogenesis and pathology of inflammatory arthritis. The
 results showed that the development of arthritis was attenuated in systemic
 Cnn2-KO mice with significantly reduced inflammation and bone erosion than
 that in age- and stain background-matched C57BL/6 wild-type mice. In vitro
 differentiation of calponin 2-null mouse bone marrow cells produced fewer
 osteoclasts with decreased bone resorption. The attenuation of inflammatory
 arthritis was confirmed in conditional myeloid cell-specific Cnn2-KO mice.
 The increased phagocytotic activity of calponin 2-null macrophages may
 facilitate the clearance of autoimmune complexes and the resolution of
 inflammation, whereas the decreased substrate adhesion may reduce
 osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. The data suggest that calponin 2
 regulation of cytoskeleton function plays a novel role in the pathogenesis of
 inflammatory arthritis, implicating a potentially therapeutic target.",

    abstract "A polyglutamine expansion within the ataxin-1 protein (ATXN1)
 underlies spinocerebellar ataxia type-1 (SCA1), a neurological disorder
 mainly characterized by ataxia and cerebellar deficits. In SCA1, both loss
 and gain of ATXN1 biological functions contribute to cerebellar pathogenesis.
 However, the critical ATXN1 functions and pathways involved remain unclear.
 To further investigate the early signalling pathways regulated by ATXN1, we
 performed an unbiased proteomic study of the Atxn1-KO 5-week-old mice
 cerebellum. Here, we show that lack of ATXN1 expression induces early
 alterations in proteins involved in glycolysis [pyruvate kinase, muscle,
 isoform 1 protein (PKM-i1), citrate synthase (CS), glycerol-3-phosphate
 dehydrogenase 2 (GPD2), glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), alpha -: enolase
 (ENO1)], ATP synthesis [CS, Succinate dehydrogenase complex,subunit A (SDHA),
 ATP synthase subunit d, mitochondrial (ATP5H)] and oxidative stress
 [peroxiredoxin-6 (PRDX6), aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1, subfamily A1,
 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase]. In the SCA1 mice, several of these
 proteins (PKM-i1, ATP5H, PRDX6, proteome subunit A6) were down-regulated and
 ATP levels decreased. The underlying mechanism does not involve modulation of
 mitochondrial biogenesis, but dysregulation of the activity of the metabolic
 regulators glycogen synthase kinase 3B (GSK3beta), decreased in Atxn1-KO and
 increased in SCA1 mice, and mechanistic target of rapamycin (serine/threonine
 kinase) (mTOR), unchanged in the Atxn1-KO and decreased in SCA1 mice
 cerebellum before the onset of ataxic symptoms. Pharmacological inhibition of
 GSK3beta and activation of mTOR in a SCA1 cell model ameliorated identified
 ATXN1-regulated metabolic proteome and ATP alterations. Taken together, these
 results point to an early role of ATXN1 in the regulation of bioenergetics
 homeostasis in the mouse cerebellum. Moreover, data suggest GSK3beta and mTOR
 pathways modulate this ATXN1 function in SCA1 pathogenesis that could be
 targeted therapeutically prior to the onset of disease symptoms in SCA1 and
 other pathologies involving dysregulation of ATXN1 functions.",

    abstract "This work is based on the comparative analysis of data obtained
 in the course of monitoring pygmy wood mouse populations (Apodemus uralensis
 Pallas, 1811) in the East-Urals Radioactive Trace (EURT) area and background
 territories. The effect of population size and its interaction with the
 radioactivity on biochemical parameters in the spleen and adrenal glands was
 studied. The concentrations of total lipids, proteins, DNA and RNA, activity
 of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase and catalase as well as the level of lipid
 peroxidation (LPO) were evaluated. The functional-metabolic shifts seen with
 large population sizes were characterized by delipidisation of adrenocortical
 cells, increased LPO as the main mechanism for steroidogenesis, growth of the
 protein components of the adrenal glands to maintain their hyperfunction, as
 well as immunosuppression associated with the restriction of carbohydrates
 providing splenocytes, reduction of DNA synthesis, and the development of a
 pro-/antioxidant imbalance. Reactivity of the neuroendocrine and
 hematopoietic systems of animals experiencing a high population density was
 higher in the EURT zone compared with the reference group. This difference
 can be explained by the additional stress from the chronic radiation
 exposure. The level of LPO, catalase activity, and DNA/protein ratio in the
 spleen and the total protein content in the adrenal glands were the most
 sensitive to the interaction of population size and radiation exposure. The
 harmful effect (distress) of the interaction of non-radiation and radiation
 factors can manifest when there is a population abundance above 30 ind./100
 trap-day and a radiation burden which exceeds the lower boundary of the
 Derived Consideration Reference Levels, which is above 0.1 mGy/day.",

    abstract "BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory
 skin disease characterized by highly pruritic eczematous lesions that are
 commonly treated with topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors.
 Side-effects and safety concerns associated with these agents restrict their
 use, and new, safe treatment options are therefore needed. Recent reports
 suggest that serotonin, i.e. 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and the 5-HT2
 receptor family may contribute to inflammation and pruritus in the skin. The
 objective of this particular study was to investigate the 5HT2B receptor
 antagonist AM1030 with respect to its anti-inflammatory profile and
 potential. METHODS: AM1030 was tested in a set of distinct human and rodent
 in vitro and in vivo models, differing with respect to e.g. T cell
 involvement, triggering stimulus, main read-outs and route of drug
 administration. The in vitro systems used were staphylococcal enterotoxin A
 (SEA)-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, lipopolysaccharide
 (LPS)-stimulated human primary monocytes, LPS-stimulated human THP-1
 monocytes and LPS-stimulated mouse primary macrophages. The in vivo systems
 used were LPS- and SEA-induced cytokine production in the mouse,
 antigen-induced arthritis in the rat, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase-induced
 arthritis in the mouse and delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction in the
 mouse. In addition, different cell populations were analyzed with respect to
 their expression of the 5-HT2B receptor at the mRNA level. RESULTS: AM1030
 significantly reduced both T cell-dependent and T cell-independent
 inflammatory responses, in vivo and in vitro. Due to the low or absent
 expression of the 5-HT2B receptor on T cell populations, the influence of
 AM1030 in T cell-dependent systems is suggested to be mediated via an
 indirect effect involving antigen-presenting cell types, such as monocytes
 and macrophages. CONCLUSION: Based on the wide range of model systems used in
 this study, differing e.g. with respect to species, T cell involvement,
 triggering stimuli, route of drug administration and read-outs, our results
 suggest a broad anti-inflammatory effect of AM1030 and identify the 5-HT2B
 receptor as a promising future target for anti-inflammatory intervention,
 e.g. in AD.",

    abstract "RNA interference (RNAi) is an effective gene-silencing tool, and
 double stranded RNA (dsRNA) is considered a powerful strategy for gene
 function studies in insects. In the present study, we aimed to investigate
 the function of trehalase (TRE) genes (TRE 1-1, TRE 1-2, and TRE-2) isolated
 from the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, a typical piercing-sucking
 insect in rice, and investigate their regulating roles in chitin synthesis by
 injecting larvae with dsRNA. The results showed that TRE1 and TRE2 had
 compensatory function, and the expression of each increased when the other
 was silenced. The total rate of insects with phenotypic deformities ranged
 from 19.83 to 24.36% after dsTRE injection, whereas the mortality rate ranged
 from 14.16 to 31.78%. The mRNA levels of genes involved in the chitin
 metabolism pathway in RNA-Seq and DGEP, namely hexokinase (HK),
 glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (G6PI) and chitinase (Cht), decreased
 significantly at 72 h after single dsTREs injection, whereas two transcripts
 of chitin synthase (CHS) genes decreased at 72 h after dsTRE1-1 and dsTREs
 injection. These results demonstrated that TRE silencing could affect the
 regulation of chitin biosynthesis and degradation, causing moulting
 deformities. Therefore, expression inhibitors of TREs might be effective
 tools for the control of planthoppers in rice.",

    abstract "The K/BxN serum-transfer arthritis (STA) model is a murine model
 in which the immunological mechanisms occurring in rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
 and other arthritides can be studied. To induce K/BxN STA, serum from
 arthritic transgenic K/BxN mice is transferred to naive mice and
 manifestations of arthritis occur a few days later. The inflammatory response
 in the model is driven by autoantibodies against the ubiquitously expressed
 self-antigen, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (G6PI), leading to the formation
 of immune complexes that drive the activation of different innate immune
 cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, and possibly mast cells. The
 pathogenesis further involves a range of immune mediators including
 cytokines, chemokines, complement factors, Toll-like receptors, Fc receptors,
 and integrins, as well as factors involved in pain and bone erosion. Hence,
 even though the K/BxN STA model mimics only the effector phase of RA, it
 still involves a wide range of relevant disease mediators. Additionally, as a
 murine model for arthritis, the K/BxN STA model has some obvious advantages.
 First, it has a rapid and robust onset of arthritis with 100% incidence in
 genetically identical animals. Second, it can be induced in a wide range of
 strain backgrounds and can therefore also be induced in gene-deficient
 strains to study the specific importance of disease mediators. Even though
 G6PI might not be an essential autoantigen, for example, in RA, the K/BxN STA
 model is a useful tool to understand how autoantibodies, in general, drive
 the progression of arthritis by interacting with downstream components of the
 innate immune system. Finally, the model has also proven useful as a model
 wherein arthritic pain can be studied. Taken together, these features make
 the K/BxN STA model a relevant one for RA, and it is a potentially valuable
 tool, especially for the preclinical screening of new therapeutic targets for
 RA and perhaps other forms of inflammatory arthritis. Here, we describe the
 molecular and cellular pathways in the development of K/BxN STA focusing on
 the recent advances in the understanding of the important mechanisms.
 Additionally, this review provides a comparison of the K/BxN STA model to
 some other arthritis models. ",

    abstract "BACKGROUND: Metabolic reprogramming is an important hallmark of
 cancer cells, including the alterations of activity and expression of enzymes
 in glucose metabolism. Previous studies have demonstrated the critical role
 of glucise-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) in cancer initiation, metastasis and
 progression. However, the significance of single nucleotide polymorphisms
 (SNPs) in GPI gene has not been investigated in hepatocellular carcinoma
 (HCC). METHODS: In this study, a total of 3 functional SNPs in GPI gene were
 genotyped in 492 HCC patients with surgical treatment. Multivariate Cox
 proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier curve were used for the analysis
 of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). RESULTS: The
 homozygous variant genotypes of rs7248411 in mRNA splice sites of GPI gene
 were significantly associated with an increased risk of death in the
 multivariate analysis (Hazard ratio [HR], 2.07; 95% confidence interval [95%
 CI]: 1.16-3.68 in a recessive model). In stratified analysis, the association
 remained significant in patients with high alpha-fetal protein (AFP) level
 (HR=2.37, 95% CI 1.25-4.49). Moreover, we identified the interaction between
 rs7248411 and AFP level in predicting the prognosis of HCC patients (P for
 interaction<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that GPI gene polymorphism
 may serve as potential biomarkers to predict the OS of HCC. Further studies
 with different ethnicities are needed to validate our findings and generalize
 its clinical utility.",

    abstract "We investigated the role of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy
 number alteration in human renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The mtDNA copy numbers
 of paired cancer and non-cancer parts from five resected RCC kidneys after
 radical nephrectomy were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction
 (Q-PCR). An RCC cell line, 786-O, was infected by lentiviral particles to
 knock down mitochondrial transcriptional factor A (TFAM). Null target (NT)
 and TFAM-knockdown (TFAM-KD) represented the control and knockdown 786-O
 clones, respectively. Protein or mRNA expression levels of TFAM;
 mtDNA-encoded NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1), ND6 and cytochrome c
 oxidase subunit 2 (COX-2); nuclear DNA (nDNA)-encoded succinate dehydrogenase
 subunit A (SDHA); v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 gene
 (AKT)-encoded AKT and v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog gene
 (c-MYC)-encoded MYC; glycolytic enzymes including hexokinase II (HK-II),
 glucose 6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), phosphofructokinase (PFK), and lactate
 dehydrogenase subunit A (LDHA); and hypoxia-inducible factors the HIF-1alpha
 and HIF-2alpha, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), and pyruvate
 dehydrogenase E1 component alpha subunit (PDHA1) were analyzed by Western
 blot or Q-PCR. Bioenergetic parameters of cellular metabolism, basal
 mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (mOCRB) and basal extracellular
 acidification rate (ECARB), were measured by a Seahorse XF(e)-24 analyzer.
 Cell invasiveness was evaluated by a trans-well migration assay and vimentin
 expression. Doxorubicin was used as a chemotherapeutic agent. The results
 showed a decrease of mtDNA copy numbers in resected RCC tissues (p = 0.043).
 The TFAM-KD clone expressed lower mtDNA copy number (p = 0.034), lower mRNA
 levels of TFAM (p = 0.008), ND1 (p = 0.007), and ND6 (p = 0.017), and lower
 protein levels of TFAM and COX-2 than did the NT clone. By contrast, the
 protein levels of HIF-2alpha, HK-II, PFK, LDHA, AKT, MYC and vimentin;
 trans-well migration activity (p = 0.007); and drug resistance to doxorubicin
 (p = 0.008) of the TFAM-KD clone were significantly higher than those of the
 NT clone. Bioenergetically, the TFAM-KD clone expressed lower mOCRB (p =
 0.009) but higher ECARB (p = 0.037) than did the NT clone. We conclude that a
 reduction of mtDNA copy number and decrease of respiratory function of
 mitochondria in RCC might be compensated for by an increase of enzymes and
 factors that are involved in the upregulation of glycolysis to confer RCC
 more invasive and a drug-resistant phenotype in vitro. ",

    abstract "Starch metabolism is involved in stomatal movement regulation.
 However, it remains unknown whether starch-deficient mutants affect
 CO2-induced stomatal closing and whether starch biosynthesis in guard cells
 and/or mesophyll cells is rate limiting for high CO2-induced stomatal
 closing. Stomatal responses to [CO2] shifts and CO2 assimilation rates were
 compared in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants that were either
 starch deficient in all plant tissues (ADP-Glc-pyrophosphorylase [ADGase]) or
 retain starch accumulation in guard cells but are starch deficient in
 mesophyll cells (plastidial phosphoglucose isomerase [pPGI]). ADGase mutants
 exhibited impaired CO2-induced stomatal closure, but pPGI mutants did not,
 showing that starch biosynthesis in guard cells but not mesophyll functions
 in CO2-induced stomatal closing. Nevertheless, starch-deficient ADGase mutant
 alleles exhibited partial CO2 responses, pointing toward a starch
 biosynthesis-independent component of the response that is likely mediated by
 anion channels. Furthermore, whole-leaf CO2 assimilation rates of both ADGase
 and pPGI mutants were lower upon shifts to high [CO2], but only ADGase
 mutants caused impairments in CO2-induced stomatal closing. These genetic
 analyses determine the roles of starch biosynthesis for high CO2-induced
 stomatal closing.",

'-hydroxy-3'-methylallyl group as the O-side chain, and lomatiol, a lapachol

 vitro growth inhibitory activities on six cancer cell lines using the MTT
 colorimetric assay, along with the respective 3',3'-dimethylallyl derivatives

 displayed the strongest growth inhibitory activities in vitro although not as

    abstract "Sclerostin, an inhibitor of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, has
 anti-anabolic effects on bone formation by negatively regulating osteoblast
 differentiation. Mutations in the human sclerostin gene (SOST) lead to
 sclerosteosis with progressive skeletal overgrowth, whereas
 sclerostin-deficient (Sost(-/-)) mice exhibit increased bone mass and
 strength. Therefore, antibody-mediated inhibition of sclerostin is currently
 being clinically evaluated for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis
 in humans. We report that in chronic TNFalpha (tumor necrosis factor
 alpha)-dependent arthritis, fibroblast-like synoviocytes constitute a major
 source of sclerostin and that either the lack of sclerostin or its
 antibody-mediated inhibition leads to an acceleration of rheumatoid arthritis
 (RA)-like disease in human TNFalpha transgenic (hTNFtg) mice with enhanced
 pannus formation and joint destruction. Inhibition of sclerostin also failed
 to improve clinical signs and joint destruction in the partially
 TNFalpha-dependent glucose-6-phosphate isomerase-induced arthritis mouse
 model, but ameliorated disease severity in K/BxN serum transfer-induced
 arthritis mouse model, which is independent of TNF receptor signaling, thus
 suggesting a specific role for sclerostin in TNFalpha signaling. Sclerostin
 effectively blocked TNFalpha- but not interleukin-1-induced activation of
 p38, a key step in arthritis development, pointing to a previously unrealized
 protective role of sclerostin in TNF-mediated chronic inflammation. The
 possibility of anti-sclerostin antibody treatment worsening clinical RA
 outcome under chronic TNFalpha-dependent inflammatory conditions in mice
 means that caution should be taken both when considering such treatment for
 inflammatory bone loss in RA and when using anti-sclerostin antibodies in
 patients with TNFalpha-dependent comorbidities. ",

    abstract "Although glycolysis is substantially elevated in many tumors,
 therapeutic targeting of glycolysis in cancer patients has not yet been
 successful, potentially reflecting the metabolic plasticity of tumor cells.
 In various cancer cells exposed to a continuous glycolytic block, we
 identified a recurrent reprogramming mechanism involving sustained mTORC1
 signaling that underlies escape from glycolytic addiction. Active mTORC1
 directs increased glucose flux via the pentose phosphate pathway back into
 glycolysis, thereby circumventing a glycolysis block and ensuring adequate
 ATP and biomass production. Combined inhibition of glycolysis and mTORC1
 signaling disrupted metabolic reprogramming in tumor cells and inhibited
 their growth in vitro and in vivo. These findings reveal novel combinatorial
 therapeutic strategies to realize the potential benefit from targeting the
 Warburg effect.",

    abstract "The androgen receptor (AR) is overexpressed and hyperactivated
 in human castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, the
 determinants of AR overexpression in CRPC are poorly defined. Here we show
 that retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma (ROR-gamma) is
 overexpressed and amplified in metastatic CRPC tumors, and that ROR-gamma
 drives AR expression in the tumors. ROR-gamma recruits nuclear receptor
 coactivator 1 and 3 (NCOA1 and NCOA3, also known as SRC-1 and SRC-3) to an
 AR-ROR response element (RORE) to stimulate AR gene transcription. ROR-gamma
 antagonists suppress the expression of both AR and its variant AR-V7 in
 prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines and tumors. ROR-gamma antagonists also
 markedly diminish genome-wide AR binding, H3K27ac abundance and expression of
 the AR target gene network. Finally, ROR-gamma antagonists suppressed tumor
 growth in multiple AR-expressing, but not AR-negative, xenograft PCa models,
 and they effectively sensitized CRPC tumors to enzalutamide, without overt
 toxicity, in mice. Taken together, these results establish ROR-gamma as a key
 player in CRPC by acting upstream of AR and as a potential therapeutic target
 for advanced PCa.",

 by phosphoglucose isomerase from Thermococcus kodakarensis (TkPGI) through 1D

 atoms in the aforementioned positions were exchanged with deuterons
 indicating that the isomerization occurred by a cis-enediol intermediate

 developed for phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) detecting as a known but rarely
 studied inhibitor of phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI). The protocol with
 NADP(+)/NBT/PMS (beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
 phosphate/nitrotetrazolium blue chloride/phenazine methosulfate) staining was
 capable of detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra PGI inhibition using
 PEP. According to this method, visibly brighter spots (zones) against purple
 background are observed in the area of inhibition of the above-mentioned
 enzyme activity. The detection limit for PEP as an inhibitor of Mycobacterium
 tuberculosis H37Ra PGI was 226 mug per spot/zone. Noteworthy is that we are
 the first authors to have successfully used a bioautographic assay to detect
 Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra PGI inhibition by PEP. ",

    abstract "BACKGROUND: A Lactobacillus-dominated cervicovaginal microbiota
 (VMB) protects women from adverse reproductive health outcomes, but the role
 of L. iners in the VMB is poorly understood. Our aim was to explore the
 association between the cervicovaginal L. iners and L. crispatus proteomes
 and VMB composition. METHODS: The vaginal proteomes of 50 Rwandan women at
 high HIV risk, grouped into four VMB groups (based on 16S rDNA microarray
 results), were investigated by mass spectrometry using cervicovaginal lavage
 (CVL) samples. Only samples with positive 16S results for L. iners and/or L.
 crispatus within each group were included in subsequent comparative protein
 analyses: Lactobacillus crispatus-dominated VMB cluster (with 16S-proven L.
 iners (ni) = 0, and with 16S-proven L. crispatus (nc) = 5), L.
 iners-dominated VMB cluster (ni = 11, nc = 4), moderate dysbiosis (ni = 12,
 nc = 2); and severe dysbiosis (ni = 8, nc = 2). The relative abundances of
 proteins that were considered specific for L. iners and L. crispatus were
 compared among VMB groups. RESULTS: Forty Lactobacillus proteins were
 identified of which 7 were specific for L. iners and 11 for L. crispatus. The
 relative abundances of L. iners DNA starvation/stationary phase protection
 protein (DPS), and the glycolysis enzymes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
 dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), were
 significantly decreased in women with L. iners-containing dysbiosis compared
 to women with a L. iners-dominated VMB, independent of vaginal pH and L.
 iners abundance. Furthermore, L. iners DPS, GAPDH, GPI, and
 fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (ALDO) were significantly negatively
 associated with vaginal pH. Glycolysis enzymes of L. crispatus showed a
 similar negative, but nonsignificant, trend related to dysbiosis.
 CONCLUSIONS: Most identified Lactobacillus proteins had conserved
 intracellular functions, but their high abundance in CVL supernatant might
 imply an additional extracellular (moonlighting) role. Our findings suggest
 that these proteins can be important in maintaining a Lactobacillus-dominated
 VMB. Functional studies are needed to investigate their roles in vaginal
 bacterial communities and whether they can be used to prevent vaginal
 dysbiosis.",

    abstract "Phosphoglucose isomerase/autocrine motility factor (PGI/AMF) is
 secreted by tumors and influences tumor growth and metastasis. In order to
 investigate the effects of silencing PGI/AMF on the migration and the sphere
 forming abilities of human glioblastoma U87 cells, as well as on the side
 population cells (SPCs), PGI/AMF was silenced using siRNA. Western blot
 analysis and RT-qPCR were used to assess the expression of PGI/AMF, Akt and
 SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 2 (SOX2). Wound healing, migration and
 tumorsphere formation assays were performed to assess invasion and metastatic
 potential. The proportion of SPCs was determined using Hoechst 33342 dye and
 flow cytometric analysis. PGI/AMF silencing inhibited the wound healing
 capacity and migration ability of U87 cells by 52.6 and 80.4%, respectively,
 compared with the scrambled siRNA (both P<0.001). Silencing of PGI/AMF
 decreased the proportion of SPCs in the U87 cells by 80.9% (P<0.01). The
 silencing of PGI/AMF decreased the number and size of tumorspheres by 53.1
 and 39.9%, respectively, compared with the scrambled siRNA (both P<0.01). The
 silencing of PGI/AMF decreased the levels of phosphorylated Akt (-71.9%,
 P<0.001) compared with the scrambled siRNA, as well as the levels of the
 stemness marker, SOX2 (-61.7%, P<0.01). Taken together, these findings
 suggest that PGI/AMF silencing decreases migration, tumorsphere formation as
 well as the proportion of SPCs in glioblastoma U87 cells. We suggest that the
 Akt pathway is involved, and our results provide a potential new target for
 the treatment of glioblastoma.",

    abstract "Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 phosphoglucose isomerase was
 purified as an active soluble form by a single-step purification using Ni-NTA
 chromatography that showed homogeneity on SDS-PAGE with molecular mass 
 approximately 62 kDa. The optimum temperature and pH for the maximum
 isomerization activity with D-galactose were 60  degrees C and 7.0,
 respectively. Generally, sugar phosphate isomerases show metal-independent
 activity but PA-PGI exhibited metal-dependent isomerization activity with
 aldosugars and optimally catalyzed the D-galactose isomerization in the
 presence of 1.0 mM MnCl2. The apparent Km and Vmax for D-galactose under
 standardized conditions were calculated to be 1029 mM (+/-31.30 with S.E.)
 and 5.95 U/mg (+/-0.9 with S.E.), respectively. Equilibrium reached after 180
 min with production of 567.51 muM D-tagatose from 1000 mM of D-galactose.
 Though, the bioconversion ratio is low but it can be increased by
 immobilization and enzyme engineering. Although various L-arabinose
 isomerases have been characterized for bioproduction of D-tagatose, P.
 aeruginosa glucose phosphate isomerase is distinguished from the other
 L-arabinose isomerases by its optimal temperature (60  degrees C) for
 D-tagatose production being mesophilic bacteria, making it an alternate
 choice for bulk production. ",

    abstract "Hirsutella sinensis is considered as the only correct anamorph
 of Ophiocordyceps sinensis. To improve cordycepin and cordycepic acid
 production in H. sinensis, the biosynthetic pathways of cordycepin and
 cordycepic acid were predicted, and verified by cloning and expressing genes
 involved in these pathways, respectively. Then, 5'-nucleotidase participating
 in biosynthetic pathway of cordycepin, hexokinase, and glucose phosphate
 isomerase involved in biosynthetic pathway of cordycepic acid, were
 demonstrated playing important roles in the corresponding biosynthetic
 pathway by real-time PCR, accompanying with significantly up-regulated
 15.03-, 5.27-, and 3.94-fold, respectively. Moreover, the metabolic
 regulation of H. sinensis was performed. As expected, cordycepin production
 reached 1.09 mg/g when additional substrate of 5'-nucleotidase was 4 mg/mL,
 resulting in an increase of 201.1 % compared with the control. In the same
 way, cordycepic acid production reached 26.6 and 23.4 % by adding substrate
 of hexokinase or glucose phosphate isomerase, leading to a rise of 77.3 and
 55.1 %, respectively. To date, this is the first time to improve cordycepin
 and cordycepic acid production through metabolic regulation based on
 biosynthetic pathway analysis, and metabolic regulation is proved as a simple
 and effective way to enhance the output of cordycepin and cordycepic acid in
 submerged cultivation of H. sinensis. ",

    abstract "BACKGROUND: For a long time cancer cells are known for increased
 uptake of glucose and its metabolization through glycolysis.
 Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a key regulatory enzyme
 of this pathway and can produce ATP through oxidative level of
 phosphorylation. Previously, we reported that GAPDH purified from a variety
 of malignant tissues, but not from normal tissues, was strongly inactivated
 by a normal metabolite, methylglyoxal (MG). Molecular mechanism behind MG
 mediated GAPDH inhibition in cancer cells is not well understood. METHODS:
 GAPDH was purified from Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cells based on its
 enzymatic activity. GAPDH associated proteins in EAC cells and
 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC) induced mouse tumor tissue were detected by mass
 spectrometry analysis and immunoprecipitation (IP) experiment, respectively.
 Interacting domains of GAPDH and its associated proteins were assessed by in
 silico molecular docking analysis. Mechanism of MG mediated GAPDH
 inactivation in cancer cells was evaluated by measuring enzyme activity,
 Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, IP and mass spectrometry analyses.
 RESULT: Here, we report that GAPDH is associated with glucose-6-phosphate
 isomerase (GPI) and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) in Ehrlich ascites carcinoma
 (EAC) cells and also in 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC) induced mouse tumor
 tissue. Molecular docking analyses suggest C-terminal domain preference for
 the interaction between GAPDH and GPI. However, both C and N termini of PKM2
 might be interacting with the C terminal domain of GAPDH. Expression of both
 PKM2 and GPI is increased in 3MC induced tumor compared with the normal
 tissue. In presence of 1 mM MG, association of GAPDH with PKM2 or GPI is not
 perturbed, but the enzymatic activity of GAPDH is reduced to 26.8 +/- 5 % in
 3MC induced tumor and 57.8 +/- 2.3 % in EAC cells. Treatment of MG to
 purified GAPDH complex leads to glycation at R399 residue of PKM2 only, and
 changes the secondary structure of the protein complex. CONCLUSION: PKM2 may
 regulate the enzymatic activity of GAPDH. Increased enzymatic activity of
 GAPDH in tumor cells may be attributed to its association with PKM2 and GPI.
 Association of GAPDH with PKM2 and GPI could be a signature for cancer cells.
 Glycation at R399 of PKM2 and changes in the secondary structure of GAPDH
 complex could be one of the mechanisms by which GAPDH activity is inhibited
 in tumor cells by MG.",

    abstract "UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) is a glucose metabolite
 with pivotal functions as a key substrate for the synthesis of
 glycoconjugates like hyaluronan, and as a metabolic sensor that controls cell
 functions through O-GlcNAc modification of intracellular proteins. However,
 little is known about the regulation of hexosamine biosynthesis that controls
 UDP-GlcNAc content. Four enzymes can catalyze the crucial starting point of
 the pathway, conversion of fructose-6-phosphate (Fru6P) to
 glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN6P): glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate
 aminotransferases (GFAT1 and 2) and glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminases
 (GNPDA1 and 2). Using siRNA silencing, we studied the contributions of these
 enzymes to UDP-GlcNAc content and hyaluronan synthesis in human
 keratinocytes. Depletion of GFAT1 reduced the cellular pool of UDP-GlcNAc and
 hyaluronan synthesis, while simultaneous blocking of both GNPDA1 and GDPDA2
 exerted opposite effects, indicating that in standard culture conditions
 keratinocyte GNPDAs mainly catalyzed the reaction from GlcN6P back to Fru6P.
 However, when hexosamine biosynthesis was blocked by GFAT1 siRNA, the effect
 by GNPDAs was reversed, now catalyzing Fru6P towards GlcN6P, likely in an
 attempt to maintain UDP-GlcNAc content. Silencing of these enzymes also
 changed the gene expression of related enzymes: GNPDA1 siRNA induced GFAT2
 which was hardly measurable in these cells under standard culture conditions,
 GNPDA2 siRNA increased GFAT1, and GFAT1 siRNA increased the expression of
 hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2). Silencing of GFAT1 stimulated GNPDA1 and
 GDPDA2, and inhibited cell migration. The multiple delicate adjustments of
 these reactions demonstrate the importance of hexosamine biosynthesis in
 cellular homeostasis, known to be deranged in diseases like diabetes and
 cancer.",

    abstract "BACKGROUND: Neotropical primates are important sylvatic hosts of
 Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. Infection is
 often subclinical, but severe disease has been described in both free-ranging
 and captive primates. Panstrongylus megistus, a major T. cruzi vector, was
 found infesting a small-primate unit at Brasilia zoo (ZooB), Brazil. ZooB
 lies close to a gallery-forest patch where T. cruzi circulates naturally.
 Here, we combine parasitological and molecular methods to investigate a focus
 of T. cruzi infection involving triatomine bugs and Neotropical primates at a
 zoo located in the Brazilian Savannah. METHODS: We assessed T. cruzi
 infection in vectors using optical microscopy (n = 34) and nested PCR (n =
 50). We used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to examine blood samples from 26
 primates and necropsy samples from two primates that died during the study.
 We determined parasite lineages in five vectors and two primates by comparing
 glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (G6pi) gene sequences. RESULTS: Trypanosoma
 cruzi was found in 44 vectors and 17 primates (six genera and eight species);
 one Mico chrysoleucus and one Saguinus niger had high parasitaemias.
 Trypanosoma cruzi DNA was detected in three primates born to qPCR-negative
 mothers at ZooB and in the two dead specimens. One Callithrix geoffroyi
 became qPCR-positive over a two-year follow-up. All G6pi sequences matched T.
 cruzi lineage TcI. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings strongly suggest vector-borne T.
 cruzi transmission within a small-primate unit at ZooB - with vectors, and
 perhaps also parasites, presumably coming from nearby gallery forest.
 Periodic checks for vectors and parasites would help eliminate T. cruzi
 transmission foci in captive-animal facilities. This should be of special
 importance for captive-breeding programs involving endangered mammals, and
 would reduce the risk of accidental T. cruzi transmission to keepers and
 veterinarians.",

    abstract "(13)C labeling experiments in aerobic glucose limited cultures
 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae at four different growth rates (0.054; 0.101,
 0.207, 0.307 h(-1)) are used for calculating fluxes that include
 intracellular cycles (e.g., storage carbohydrate cycles, exchange fluxes with
 amino acids), which are rearranged depending on the growth rate. At low
 growth rates the impact of the storage carbohydrate recycle is relatively
 more significant than at high growth rates due to a higher concentration of
 these materials in the cell (up to 560-fold) and higher fluxes relative to
 the glucose uptake rate (up to 16%). Experimental observations suggest that
 glucose can be exported to the extracellular space, and that its source is
 related to storage carbohydrates, most likely via the export and subsequent
 extracellular breakdown of trehalose. This hypothesis is strongly supported
 by (13)C-labeling experimental data, measured extracellular trehalose, and
 the corresponding flux estimations.",

    abstract "Although regulatory T (Treg) cells are necessary to prevent
 autoimmune diseases, including arthritis, whether Treg cells can ameliorate
 established inflammatory disease is controversial. Using the
 glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (G6PI)-induced arthritis model in mice, we
 aimed to determine the therapeutic efficacy of increasing Treg cell number
 and function during chronic destructive arthritis. Chronic destructive
 arthritis was induced by transient depletion of Treg cells prior to
 immunization with G6PI. At different time points after disease induction,
 mice were treated with a CD28 superagonistic antibody (CD28SA). CD28SA
 treatment during the induction phase of arthritis ameliorated the acute signs
 of arthritis and completely prevented the development of chronic destructive
 arthritis. CD28SA treatment of mice with fully developed arthritis induced a
 significant reduction in clinical and histological signs of arthritis. When
 given during the chronic destructive phase of arthritis, 56 days after
 disease induction, CD28SA treatment resulted in a modest reduction of
 clinical signs of arthritis and a reduction in histopathological signs of
 joint inflammation. Our data show that increasing the number and activation
 of Treg cells by a CD28SA is therapeutically effective in experimental
 arthritis.",

    abstract "Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is difficult to
 diagnose; diagnosis relies on clinical, radiological, pathological, and
 serological criteria. Our aim was to assess the performance of two new
 commercially available kits and a new in-house assay: an Aspergillus
 fumigatus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgG kit (Bordier Affinity
 Products), an Aspergillus Western blotting IgG kit (LDBio Diagnostics), and a
 new in-house time-resolved fluorometric IgE assay (dissociation-enhanced
 lanthanide fluorescent immunoassay, or DELFIA) using recombinant proteins
 from an Aspergillus sp. recently developed by our laboratory for ABPA
 diagnosis in a retrospective study that included 26 cystic fibrosis patients.
 Aspergillus fumigatus-specific IgG levels measured by a commercial ELISA kit
 were in accordance with the level of precipitins currently used in our lab.
 The ELISA kit could accelerate and help standardize ABPA diagnosis.
 Aspergillus fumigatus-specific IgE levels measured by ImmunoCAP (Phadia) with
 A. fumigatus M3 antigen and by DELFIA with a purified protein extract of A.
 fumigatus were significantly correlated (P < 10(-6)). The results with
 recombinant antigens glucose-6-phosphate isomerase and mannitol-1-phosphate
 dehydrogenase were encouraging but must be confirmed with sera from more
 patients. The DELFIA is an effective tool that can detect specific IgE
 against more fungal allergens than can be detected with other commercially
 available tests. ",

    abstract "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) significantly influence the
 development and regulation of genome expression in cells. Here, we
 demonstrate the role of lncRNA ceruloplasmin (NRCP) in cancer metabolism and
 elucidate functional effects leading to increased tumor progression. NRCP was
 highly upregulated in ovarian tumors, and knockdown of NRCP resulted in
 significantly increased apoptosis, decreased cell proliferation, and
 decreased glycolysis compared with control cancer cells. In an orthotopic
 mouse model of ovarian cancer, siNRCP delivered via a liposomal carrier
 significantly reduced tumor growth compared with control treatment. We
 identified NRCP as an intermediate binding partner between STAT1 and RNA
 polymerase II, leading to increased expression of downstream target genes
 such as glucose-6-phosphate isomerase. Collectively, we report a previously
 unrecognized role of the lncRNA NRCP in modulating cancer metabolism. As
 demonstrated, DOPC nanoparticle-incorporated siRNA-mediated silencing of this
 lncRNA in vivo provides therapeutic avenue toward modulating lncRNAs in
 cancer.",

    abstract "BACKGROUND: Phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) genes are important
 multifunctional proteins whose evolution has, until now, not been well
 elucidated because of the limited number of completely sequenced genomes.
 Although the multifunctionality of this gene family has been considered as an
 original and innate characteristic, PGI genes may have acquired novel
 functions through changes in coding sequences and exon/intron structure,
 which are known to lead to functional divergence after gene duplication. A
 whole-genome comparative approach was used to estimate the rates of molecular
 evolution of this protein family. RESULTS: The results confirm the presence
 of two isoforms in teleost fishes and only one variant in all other
 vertebrates. Phylogenetic reconstructions grouped the PGI genes into five
 main groups: lungfishes/coelacanth/cartilaginous fishes, teleost fishes,
 amphibians, reptiles/birds and mammals, with the teleost group being
 subdivided into two subclades comprising PGI1 and PGI2. This PGI partitioning
 into groups is consistent with the synteny and molecular evolution results
 based on the estimation of the ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous changes
 (Ka/Ks) and divergence rates between both PGI paralogs and orthologs. Teleost
 PGI2 shares more similarity with the variant found in all other vertebrates,
 suggesting that it has less evolved than PGI1 relative to the PGI of common
 vertebrate ancestor. CONCLUSIONS: The diversification of PGI genes into PGI1
 and PGI2 is consistent with a teleost-specific duplication before the
 radiation of this lineage, and after its split from the other infraclasses of
 ray-finned fishes. The low average Ka/Ks ratios within teleost and mammalian
 lineages suggest that both PGI1 and PGI2 are functionally constrained by
 purifying selection and may, therefore, have the same functions. By contrast,
 the high average Ka/Ks ratios and divergence rates within reptiles and birds
 indicate that PGI may be involved in different functions. The synteny
 analyses show that the genomic region harbouring PGI genes has independently
 undergone genomic rearrangements in mammals versus the reptile/bird lineage
 in particular, which may have contributed to the actual functional
 diversification of this gene family.",

    abstract "Horizontal gene transfer involves the non-sexual interspecific
 transmission of genetic material. Even if they are initially functional,
 horizontally transferred genes are expected to deteriorate into non-expressed
 pseudogenes, unless they become adaptively relevant in the recipient
 organism. However, little is known about the distributions of natural
 transgenes within wild species or the adaptive significance of natural
 transgenes within wild populations. Here, we examine the distribution of a
 natural plant-to-plant nuclear transgene in relation to environmental
 variation within a wild population. Festuca ovina is polymorphic for an extra
 (second) expressed copy of the nuclear gene (PgiC) encoding cytosolic
 phosphoglucose isomerase, with the extra PgiC locus having been acquired
 horizontally from the distantly related grass genus Poa. We investigated
 variation at PgiC in samples of F. ovina from a fine-scale, repeating
 patchwork of grassland microhabitats, replicated within spatially separated
 sites. Even after accounting for spatial effects, the distributions of F.
 ovina individuals carrying the additional PgiC locus, and one of the enzyme
 products encoded by the locus, are significantly associated with fine-scale
 habitat variation. Our results suggest that the PgiC transgene contributes,
 together with the unlinked 'native' PgiC locus, to local adaptation to a
 fine-scale mosaic of edaphic and biotic grassland microhabitats. ",

    abstract "Cannabinoid CB1 receptors peripherally modulate energy
 metabolism. Here, we investigated the role of CB1 receptors in the expression
 of glucose/pyruvate/tricarboxylic acid (TCA) metabolism in rat abdominal
 muscle. Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD), a flavoprotein component (E3)
 of alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes with diaphorase activity in
 mitochondria, was specifically analyzed. After assessing the effectiveness of
 the CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 (3 mg kg(-1), 14 days) on food intake and
 body weight, we could identified seven key enzymes from either glycolytic
 pathway or TCA cycle--regulated by both diet and CB1 receptor
 activity--through comprehensive proteomic approaches involving
 two-dimensional electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/LC-ESI trap mass spectrometry.
 These enzymes were glucose 6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), triosephosphate
 isomerase (TPI), enolase (Eno3), lactate dehydrogenase (LDHa), glyoxalase-1
 (Glo1) and the mitochondrial DLD, whose expressions were modified by AM251 in
 hypercaloric diet-induced obesity. Specifically, AM251 blocked
 high-carbohydrate diet (HCD)-induced expression of GPI, TPI, Eno3 and LDHa,
 suggesting a down-regulation of glucose/pyruvate/lactate pathways under
 glucose availability. AM251 reversed the HCD-inhibited expression of Glo1 and
 DLD in the muscle, and the DLD and CB1 receptor expression in the
 mitochondrial fraction. Interestingly, we identified the presence of CB1
 receptors at the membrane of striate muscle mitochondria. DLD over-expression
 was confirmed in muscle of CB1-/- mice. AM251 increased the pyruvate
 dehydrogenase and glutathione reductase activity in C2C12 myotubes, and the
 diaphorase/oxidative activity in the mitochondria fraction. These results
 indicated an up-regulation of methylglyoxal and TCA cycle activity. Findings
 suggest that CB1 receptors in muscle modulate glucose/pyruvate/lactate
 pathways and mitochondrial oxidative activity by targeting DLD.",

    abstract "Cell wall proteins of Candida albicans, besides their best known
 role in the adhesion of this fungal pathogen to host's tissues, also bind
 some soluble proteins, present in body fluids and involved in maintaining the
 biochemical homeostasis of the human organism. In particular, three plasma
 factors - high-molecular-mass kininogen (HK), factor XII (FXII) and
 prekallikrein (PPK) - have been shown to adhere to candidal cells. These
 proteins are involved in the surface-contact-catalyzed production of
 bradykinin-related peptides (kinins) that contribute to inflammatory states
 associated with microbial infections. We recently identified several
 proteins, associated with the candidal cell walls, and probably involved in
 the binding of HK. In our present study, a list of potential FXII- and
 PPK-binding proteins was proposed, using an affinity selection (on
 agarose-coupled FXII or PPK) from a whole mixture of
 beta-1,3-glucanase-extrated cell wall-associated proteins and the
 mass-spectrometry protein identification. Five of these fungal proteins,
 including agglutinin-like sequence protein 3 (Als3), triosephosphate
 isomerase 1 (Tpi1), enolase 1 (Eno1), phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (Gpm1) and
 glucose-6-phosphate isomerase 1 (Gpi1), were purified and characterized in
 terms of affinities to the human contact factors, using the surface plasmon
 resonance measurements. Except Gpm1 that bound only PPK, and Als3 that
 exhibited an affinity to HK and FXII, the other isolated proteins interacted
 with all three contact factors. The determined dissociation constants for the
 identified protein complexes were of 10(-7) M order, and the association rate
 constants were in a range of 10(4)-10(5) M(-1)s(-1). The identified fungal
 pathogen-host protein interactions are potential targets for novel
 anticandidal therapeutic approaches. ",

    abstract "Metabolic adaptations are intimately associated with changes in
 cell behavior. Cancers are characterized by a high metabolic plasticity
 resulting from mutations and the selection of metabolic phenotypes conferring
 growth and invasive advantages. While metabolic plasticity allows cancer
 cells to cope with various microenvironmental situations that can be
 encountered in a primary tumor, there is increasing evidence that metabolism
 is also a major driver of cancer metastasis. Rather than a general switch
 promoting metastasis as a whole, a succession of metabolic adaptations is
 more likely needed to promote different steps of the metastatic process. This
 review addresses the contribution of pH, glycolysis and the pentose phosphate
 pathway, and a companion paper summarizes current knowledge regarding the
 contribution of mitochondria, lipids and amino acid metabolism. Extracellular
 acidification, intracellular alkalinization, the glycolytic enzyme
 phosphoglucose isomerase acting as an autocrine cytokine, lactate and the
 pentose phosphate pathway are emerging as important factors controlling
 cancer metastasis. ",

    abstract "The DNA repair enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase
 (MGMT) is commonly overexpressed in cancers and is implicated in the
 development of chemoresistance. The use of drugs inhibiting MGMT has been
 hindered by their haematologic toxicity and inefficiency. As a different
 strategy to inhibit MGMT we investigated cellular regulators of MGMT
 expression in multiple cancers. Here we show a significant correlation
 between Wnt signalling and MGMT expression in cancers with different origin
 and confirm the findings by bioinformatic analysis and immunofluorescence. We
 demonstrate Wnt-dependent MGMT gene expression and cellular co-localization
 between active beta-catenin and MGMT. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition
 of Wnt activity downregulates MGMT expression and restores chemosensitivity
 of DNA-alkylating drugs in mouse models. These findings have potential
 therapeutic implications for chemoresistant cancers, especially of brain
 tumours where the use of temozolomide is frequently used in treatment. ",

    abstract "Mesenchymal stem cells promising role in cell-based therapies
 and tissue engineering appears to be limited due to a decline of their
 regenerative potential with increasing donor age. Six age groups from bone
 marrow mesenchymal stem cells of Wistar rats were studied (newborn, infant,
 young, pre-pubertal, pubertal and adult). Quantitative proteomic assay was
 performance by iTRAQ using an 8-plex iTRAQ labeling and the proteins
 differentially expressed were grouped in pluripotency, proliferative and
 metabolism processes. Proliferation makers, CD117 and Ki67 were measure by
 flow cytometry assay. Real time polymerase chain reaction analysis of
 pluripotency markers Rex1, Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog were done. Biological
 differentiation was realized using specific mediums for 14 days to induce
 osteogenesis, adipogenesis or chondrogenesis and immunostain analysis of
 differentiated cell resulting were done. Enzimoimmunoassay analysis of
 several enzymes as L-lactate dehydrogenase and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase
 were also done to validate iTRAQ data. Taking together these results indicate
 for the first time that mesenchymal stem cells have significant differences
 in their proliferative, pluripotency and metabolism profiles and those
 differences are age depending. ",

    abstract "Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), also known as
 phosphoglucose isomerase, was initially identified as the second glycolytic
 enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion of glucose-6-phosphate to
 fructose-6-phosphate. Later studies demonstrated that GPI was the same as the
 autocrine motility factor (AMF), and that it mediates its biological effects
 through the interaction with its surface receptor (AMFR/gp78). In this study,
 we assessed the role of GPI/AMF as a prognostic factor for clear cell renal
 cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cancer-specific (CSS) and progression-free survival
 (PFS). In addition, we evaluated the expression and localization of GPI/AMF
 and AMFR, using tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry (TMA-IHC),
 indirect immunofluorescence (IF), and confocal microscopy analysis.Primary
 renal tumor and nonneoplastic tissues were collected from 180 patients who
 underwent nephrectomy for ccRCC. TMA-IHC and IF staining showed an increased
 signal for both GPI and AMFR in cancer cells, and their colocalization on
 plasma membrane. Kaplan-Meier curves showed significant differences in CSS
 and PFS among groups of patients with high versus low GPI expression. In
 particular, patients with high tissue levels of GPI had a 5-year survival
 rate of 58.8%, as compared to 92.1% for subjects with low levels (P <
 0.0001). Similar findings were observed for PFS (56.8% vs 93.3% at 5 years).
 At multivariate analysis, GPI was an independent adverse prognostic factor
 for CSS (HR = 1.26; P = 0.001), and PFS (HR = 1.16; P = 0.01).In conclusion,
 our data suggest that GPI could serve as a marker of ccRCC aggressiveness and
 a prognostic factor for CSS and PFS. ",

    abstract "Due to the low proliferative and migratory capacities of
 chondrocytes, cartilage repair remains a challenging clinical problem.
 Current therapeutic strategies for cartilage repair result in unsatisfactory
 outcomes. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is a cell based therapy
 that relies on the in vitro expansion of healthy chondrocytes from the
 patient, during which proliferationpromoting factors are frequently used.
 Neuroleukin (NLK) is a multifunctional protein that possesses growth factor
 functions, and its expression has been associated with cartilage development
 and bone regeneration, however its direct role in chondrocyte proliferation
 remains to be fully elucidated. In the current study, the role of NLK in
 chondrocyte proliferation in vitro in addition to its potential to act as an
 exogenous factor during ACI was investigated. Furthermore, the concentration
 of NLK for in vitro chondrocyte culture was optimized using a microfluidic
 device. An NLK concentration of 12.85 ng/ml was observed to provide optimal
 conditions for the promotion of chondrocyte proliferation. Additionally, NLK
 stimulation resulted in an increase in type II collagen synthesis by
 chondrocytes, which is a cartilaginous secretion marker and associated with
 the phenotype of chondrocytes. Together these data suggest that NLK is able
 to promote cell proliferation and type II collagen synthesis during in vitro
 chondrocyte propagation, and thus may serve as an exogenous factor for ACI.",

    abstract "BACKGROUND: Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase and collagen type II
 antibody-induced arthritis models (K/BxN and CAIA, respectively) have an
 inflammatory and a post-inflammatory phase. Both phases display robust
 tactile allodynia. In previous work, inflammatory phase allodynia was
 reversed by gabapentin and ketorolac, whereas in late phase only gabapentin
 was effective. Here, we sought to determine if the effects of these two drugs
 during the early and late phases of the two arthritis models were observed in
 the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm, indicating a differential
 drug effect on the aversive state. METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice received K/BxN
 serum intraperitoneally, while male BALB/c mice received collagen type II
 antibody cocktail intravenously. After onset of inflammation and allodynia,
 we assessed effects of i.p. gabapentin (100 mg/kg) or ketorolac (15 mg/kg)
 using a CPP paradigm: 2 days adaptation, 2 days conditioning (vehicle in
 morning and drug in afternoon), preference testing on day 5. RESULTS:
 Consistent with the effects upon allodynia, both gabapentin and ketorolac
 produced a preference for the drug-paired compartment in the early phase of
 the K/BxN model, while gabapentin, but not ketorolac, resulted in a place
 preference during late phase. In the CAIA model, consistent with differential
 effects upon allodynia, gabapentin produced a preference in the early phase
 and a trend in the late phase, whereas ketorolac was ineffective at either
 time. CONCLUSIONS: CPP validated the aversive state in the inflammatory and
 post-inflammatory phases of the K/BxN and CAIA arthritis models and
 correspondence between the anti-hyperpathic pharmacology as defined by
 thresholds and CPP.",

    abstract "OBJECTIVE: Antibody-mediated autoimmunity involves cognate
 interactions between self-reactive T cells and B cells during germinal center
 (GC) reactions. The aim of this study was to determine the role of essential
 follicular helper T (Tfh) cell molecules (CXCR5, signaling lymphocytic
 activation molecule-associated protein) on autoreactive CD4+ cells and the
 role of certain environmental influences that may determine GC-driven
 autoantibody production and arthritis development. METHODS: We transferred
 self-reactive CD4+ cells from KRN-Tg mice into recipient mice, which induced
 autoantibodies and autoinflammatory arthritis. This model allowed
 manipulation of environmental effects, such as inflammation, and use of
 transferred cells that were genetically deficient in important Tfh
 cell-associated molecules. RESULTS: A deficiency of signaling lymphocytic
 activation molecule-associated protein (SAP) in CD4+ cells from KRN-Tg mice
 completely protected against arthritis, indicating that stable T cell-B cell
 interactions are required for GC formation, autoantibody production, and
 arthritis induction. In contrast, a CXCR5 deficiency in CD4+ cells from
 KRN-Tg mice still induced disease when these cells were transferred into
 wild-type mice, suggesting that T cell help for B cells could rely on other
 migration mechanisms. However, various manipulations influenced this system,
 including elimination of bystander effects through use of CD28(-/-) recipient
 mice (reduced disease) or use of inflammation-inducing Freund's complete
 adjuvant (progression to arthritis). We also examined the capacity of
 preexisting GCs with a nonautoimmune specificity to co-opt autoimmune T cells
 and observed no evidence for any influence. CONCLUSION: In addition to the
 quality and quantity of cognate CD4+ cell help, external factors such as
 inflammation and noncognate CD4+ cell bystander activation trigger
 autoimmunity by shaping events within autoimmune GC responses. SAP is an
 essential molecule for autoimmune antibody production, whereas the importance
 of CXCR5 varies depending on the circumstances.",

    abstract "BACKGROUND: Methane represents 16 % of total anthropogenic
 greenhouse gas emissions. It has been estimated that ruminant livestock
 produce ca. 29 % of this methane. As individual animals produce consistently
 different quantities of methane, understanding the basis for these
 differences may lead to new opportunities for mitigating ruminal methane
 emissions. Metagenomics is a powerful new tool for understanding the
 composition and function of complex microbial communities. Here we have
 applied metagenomics to the rumen microbial community to identify differences
 in the microbiota and metagenome that lead to high- and low-methane-emitting
 cattle phenotypes. METHODS: Four pairs of beef cattle were selected for
 extreme high and low methane emissions from 72 animals, matched for breed
 (Aberdeen-Angus or Limousin cross) and diet (high or medium concentrate).
 Community analysis was carried out by qPCR of 16S and 18S rRNA genes and by
 alignment of Illumina HiSeq reads to the GREENGENES database. Total genomic
 reads were aligned to the KEGG genes databasefor functional analysis.
 RESULTS: Deep sequencing produced on average 11.3 Gb per sample. 16S rRNA
 gene abundances indicated that archaea, predominantly Methanobrevibacter,
 were 2.5x more numerous (P = 0.026) in high emitters, whereas among bacteria
 Proteobacteria, predominantly Succinivibrionaceae, were 4-fold less abundant
 (2.7 vs. 11.2 %; P = 0.002). KEGG analysis revealed that archaeal genes
 leading directly or indirectly to methane production were 2.7-fold more
 abundant in high emitters. Genes less abundant in high emitters included
 acetate kinase, electron transport complex proteins RnfC and RnfD and
 glucose-6-phosphate isomerase. Sequence data were assembled de novo and over
 1.5 million proteins were annotated on the subsequent metagenome scaffolds.
 Less than half of the predicted genes matched matched a domain within Pfam.
 Amongst 2774 identified proteins of the 20 KEGG orthologues that correlated
 with methane emissions, only 16 showed 100 % identity with a publicly
 available protein sequence. CONCLUSIONS: The abundance of archaeal genes in
 ruminal digesta correlated strongly with differing methane emissions from
 individual animals, a finding useful for genetic screening purposes. Lower
 emissions were accompanied by higher Succinovibrionaceae abundance and
 changes in acetate and hydrogen production leading to less methanogenesis, as
 similarly postulated for Australian macropods. Large numbers of predicted
 protein sequences differed between high- and low-methane-emitting cattle.
 Ninety-nine percent were unknown, indicating a fertile area for future
 exploitation.",

 is a cell based therapy that uses in vitro amplified healthy chondrocytes
 from the patient. However, chondrocyte dedifferentiation during in vitro
 culture limits its application. Neuroleukin (NLK) is a multifunctional
 protein that stimulates cell growth and migration, together with its receptor
 autocrine motility factor receptor (AMFR, also called gp78). We investigated
 expression of NLK and AMFR/gp78 during cartilage development in vivo and in
 cultured articular chondrocytes in vitro, and found the pair associates with
 chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation. While applied to isolated
 articular chondrocytes, NLK promotes cell proliferation and secretion of type
 II collagen, a marker of proliferating chondrocytes. Further work
 demonstrates that NLK up regulates pAKT and pSmad2/3, but down regulates
 pSmad1/5. In animals, NLK treatment also promotes chondrocyte proliferation
 while inhibits terminal differentiation, leading to expanded proliferating
 zone but decreased prehypertrophic and hypertrophic zones in the growth plate
 region. NLK is therefore a candidate factor that can be applied in the
 treatment of cartilage defects. ",

    abstract "Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (G6PI) and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine
 pyrophosphorylase (UAP), two key components in the chitin biosynthesis
 pathway, are critical for insect growth and metamorphosis. In this study, we
 identified the genes BdG6PI and BdUAP from the oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera
 dorsalis (Hendel). The open reading frames (ORFs) of BdG6PI (1,491 bp) and
 BdUAP (1,677 bp) encoded 496 and 558 amino acid residues, respectively.
 Multiple sequence alignments showed that BdG6PI and BdUAP had high amino acid
 sequence identity with other insect homologues. Quantitative real-time
 polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis indicated that BdG6PI was mainly
 expressed in the early stages of third-instar larvae and adults, while
 significantly higher expression of BdUAP was observed in adults. Both
 transcripts were expressed highly in the Malpighian tubules, but only
 slightly in the tracheae. The expression of both BdG6PI and BdUAP was
 significantly up-regulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone exposure and down-regulated
 by starvation. Moreover, injection of double-stranded RNAs of BdG6PI and
 BdUAP into third-instar larvae significantly reduced the corresponding gene
 expressions. Additionally, silencing of BdUAP resulted in 65% death and
 abnormal phenotypes of larvae, while silencing of BdG6PI had a slight effect
 on insect molting. These findings provide some data on the roles of BdG6PI
 and BdUAP in B. dorsalis and demonstrate the potential role for BdUAP in
 larval-pupal transition.",

    abstract "BACKGROUND: Candida parapsilosis and C. tropicalis increasingly
 compete with C. albicans-the most common fungal pathogen in humans-as
 causative agents of severe candidiasis in immunocompromised patients. In
 contrast to C. albicans, the pathogenic mechanisms of these two non-albicans
 Candida species are poorly understood. Adhesion of Candida yeast to host
 cells and the extracellular matrix is critical for fungal invasion of hosts.
 METHODS: The fungal proteins involved in interactions with extracellular
 matrix proteins were isolated from mixtures of beta-1,3-glucanase- or
 beta-1,6-glucanase-extractable cell wall-associated proteins by use of
 affinity chromatography and chemical cross-linking methods, and were further
 identified by liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry.
 RESULTS: In the present study, we characterized the binding of three major
 extracellular matrix proteins--fibronectin, vitronectin and laminin--to C.
 parapsilosis and C. tropicalis pseudohyphae. The major individual compounds
 of the fungal cell wall that bound fibronectin, vitronectin and laminin were
 found to comprise two groups: (1) true cell wall components similar to C.
 albicans adhesins from the Als, Hwp and Iff/Hyr families; and (2) atypical
 (cytoplasm-derived) surface-exposed proteins, including malate synthase,
 glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, enolase,
 fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, transketolase, transaldolase and elongation
 factor 2. DISCUSSION: The adhesive abilities of two investigated non-albicans
 Candida species toward extracellular matrix proteins were comparable to those
 of C. albicans suggesting an important role of this particular virulence
 attribute in the pathogenesis of infections caused by C. tropicalis and C.
 parapsilosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal new insight into host-pathogen
 interactions during infections by two important, recently emerging, fungal
 pathogens.",

    abstract "The objectives of this study are to investigate the prevalence
 of PAD4 and anti-PAD4 antibodies (Abs) in autoimmune diseases and to clarify
 their association with anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) and
 shared epitope (SE) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Levels of
 human PAD4 and anti-PAD4 Abs in serum or plasma were measured using sandwich
 ELISA. Samples were obtained from patients with RA (n = 148), SLE (n = 36),
 or SS (n = 37) and from healthy controls (HCs; n = 40). Antibodies against
 cyclic citrullinated glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) (CCG)-2, CCG-7,
 anti-CEP-1, and anti-CCP Abs were also measured using ELISA. Patients with RA
 were genotyped for HLA-DRB1. The human PAD4 and anti-PAD4 Ab levels were
 compared with the ACPA and SE in patients with RA. The PAD4 levels were 111.9
 U/ml in the RA, 30.4 U/ml in the SLE, 81.9 U/ml in the SS patients, and 46.6
 U/ml in the HCs. The PAD4 levels were significantly higher in the RA than in
 the SLE patients or the HCs. Anti-PAD4 Abs were detected in 29.7 % of the
 patients with RA, but not in the patients with SLE or SS, nor in the HCs. In
 the RA patients, the PAD4 levels in the anti-PAD4 Ab-negative group were
 significantly higher than those in the anti-PAD4 Ab-positive group. Moreover,
 anti-CCG-2, CCG-7, CEP-1, and anti-CCP Ab levels were significantly higher in
 the anti-PAD4 Ab-positive group than in the anti-PAD4 Ab-negative group. In
 the RA patients, the PAD4 levels were not correlated with ACPAs. Neither PAD4
 nor anti-PAD4 Abs were significantly correlated with the presence of SE
 alleles. The PAD4 levels were higher in RA than in SLE or HC. Anti-PAD4 Abs
 appeared specifically in patients with RA. Moreover, anti-PAD4 Abs were
 associated with ACPAs. ",
