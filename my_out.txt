 Here, we analyzed the
 kinetics of Golgi breakdown in the absence of COPII-dependent ER export with
 high temporal and spatial resolution using quantitative fluorescence
 microscopy.

 On the basis of the
 site of coated vesicle accumulation, cisternal dilation and the normal
 kinetics of cargo transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi
 followed by delayed Golgi to cell surface transport, we suggest that Golgi
 function in cargo transport is preferentially inhibited at the
 trans-Golgi/trans-Golgi network (TGN).

 The addition of aluminium fluoride locks coatomer onto Golgi membranes and
 also decreases the binding kinetics of both ARF1 and ARFGAP1, suggesting that
 these proteins function in concert to mediate sorting and vesicle formation

 To determine whether arf mutants exhibit similar phenotypes, the
 anterograde transport kinetics of multiple cargo proteins were examined in
 arf mutant cells, and, surprisingly, both COPI-dependent and COPI-independent
 cargo proteins exhibited comparable defects.

 Thus, activation of
 the sympathetic nervous system releases this population of KATP channels from
 storage in the Golgi and, hence, might facilitate the adaptive response to
 metabolic challenges

 RESULTS: By employing a tetrameric affinity construct of the C terminus of
 the K(ATP) channel alpha subunit, Kir6.2, we found that 14-3-3 isoforms
 epsilon and zeta specifically recognize the arginine-based ER localization
 signal present in this cytosolic tail.

 The phosphorylating activity
 of a protein kinase C, however, plays no role in vesicle formation, since
 this process does not require ATP

 Inhibition of fusion by activated ARF is also
 independent of endosomal acidification since assays performed in the presence
 of the vacuolar ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 are equally sensitive to
 GTPgammaS-bound ARF.
