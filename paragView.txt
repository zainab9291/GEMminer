<p>The copy number of membrane proteins at the cell surface is tightly regulated. Many ion channels and receptors present retrieval motifs to COPI vesicle coats and are retained in the early secretory pathway. In some cases, the interaction with COPI is prevented by binding to 14-3-3 proteins. However, the functional significance of this antagonism between COPI and 14-3-3 in terminally differentiated cells is unknown. Here, we show that ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channels, which are composed of Kir6.2 and SUR1 subunits, are stalled in the Golgi complex of ventricular, but not atrial, cardiomyocytes. Upon sustained &#x3B2;-adrenergic stimulation, which leads to activation of protein kinase A (PKA), SUR1-containing channels reach the plasma membrane of ventricular cells. We show that PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the C-terminus of Kir6.2 decreases binding to COPI and, thereby, silences the arginine-based retrieval signal. Thus, activation of the sympathetic nervous system releases this population of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels from storage in the Golgi and, hence, might facilitate the adaptive response to metabolic challenges.</p>

<p>Hormone signaling rapidly adapts the function of cells to the physiological requirements of the organism. Regulated translocation of ion channels and transporters to the plasma membrane is one important mechanism of the cellular response. Prominent examples include insulin-triggered GLUT4 translocation (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">Bogan, 2012</xref>) and growth-hormone-induced translocation of TRPC5 channels (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">Abe and Puertollano, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">Bezzerides et al., 2004</xref>). Specialized post-Golgi storage vesicles and endosomal membranes contribute to the storage, rapid exposure and recycling of such cargo proteins, but the extent of the participation of the early secretory pathway in the regulated deployment of membrane proteins is unknown. Here, we consider the metabolically-sensitive ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channel as an example of a heteromultimeric cargo protein that is stored in, and released from, the Golgi compartment upon hormone-induced signal transduction.</p>

<p>K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are hetero-octameric multimers of four pore-forming Kir6.1 (<italic>KCNJ8</italic>) or Kir6.2 (<italic>KCNJ11</italic>) subunits and four sulfonylurea receptor [SUR1 (<italic>ABCC8</italic>) or SUR2 (<italic>ABCC9</italic>)] subunits (<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">Nichols, 2006</xref>). Coexpression of the two types of subunit is necessary to achieve functional expression of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels (<xref rid="b54" ref-type="bibr">Tucker et al., 1997</xref>) through a checkpoint mechanism (<xref rid="b59" ref-type="bibr">Zerangue et al., 1999</xref>) &#x2013; the exposure of arginine (Arg)-based ER retention and retrieval motifs by Kir6.2 and SUR1 prevents cell surface transport unless stoichiometrically assembled hetero-octamers are formed. Subsequent work has identified the COPI complex as the vesicle coat involved in the recognition of Arg-based signals (<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">Michelsen et al., 2007</xref>) and 14-3-3 proteins as a cytosolic factor that facilitates efficient cell surface expression (<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">Heusser et al., 2006</xref>). The latter finding coincided with the discovery that many ion channels and plasma membrane proteins strictly require 14-3-3 to reach the cell surface (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">G&#xF6;dde et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">O'Kelly et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">Rajan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2011</xref>). For such cargo proteins, the lack of an interaction with 14-3-3 leads to an accumulation of cargo in the Golgi compartment (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">G&#xF6;dde et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b63" ref-type="bibr">Zuzarte et al., 2009</xref>). Intriguingly, all cargo proteins that require 14-3-3 for cell surface expression also possess COPI-interaction motifs (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">G&#xF6;dde et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">O'Kelly et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">O'Kelly and Goldstein, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">Shikano et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b63" ref-type="bibr">Zuzarte et al., 2009</xref>), raising the possibility that the antagonism between COPI and 14-3-3 is a key control mechanism of Golgi trafficking. 14-3-3 proteins predominantly recognize phosphorylated client proteins and participate in signal transduction cascades (<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">Morrison, 2009</xref>). Taken together, these facts evoke the hypothesis that cargo interactions with COPI and 14-3-3 might underlie physiologically regulated sorting events, in addition to providing a basic assembly checkpoint.</p>

<p>Native K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are highly expressed in multiple tissues. In cardiac muscle cells, they couple electrical and metabolic signals at the cell surface during adaptation to stress (<xref rid="b62" ref-type="bibr">Zingman et al., 2002</xref>), hyperpolarizing the cells and preventing Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry under conditions of energy depletion. Thus, they might offer protection from life-threatening heart damage during ischemia or sustained &#x3B2;-adrenergic stimulation, as demonstrated previously in mice that had genetic deletions of K<sub>ATP</sub> channel subunits (<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">Miki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="b52" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="b56" ref-type="bibr">Yamada et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b62" ref-type="bibr">Zingman et al., 2002</xref>). Human K<sub>ATP</sub> mutations, many of which affect the trafficking of the channel (<xref rid="b57" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2007</xref>), underlie different K<sub>ATP</sub> channelopathies and can substantially increase the risk for heart disease (<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">Nichols et al., 2013</xref>). All four types of K<sub>ATP</sub> subunits have been identified in the heart (<xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">Philip-Couderc et al., 2008</xref>), but expression varies from region to region and can change under pathophysiological conditions (<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">Isidoro Tavares et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">Isidoro Tavares et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">Raeis-Dauv&#xE9; et al., 2012</xref>). From the genetically tractable mouse heart, it is clear that SUR2A and Kir6.2 subunits are important components of ventricular K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, whereas SUR1 and Kir6.2 subunits are crucial for atrial channels (<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">Flagg et al., 2008</xref>). Of note, these two subunits also form the pancreatic K<sub>ATP</sub> channel complex, which is essential for insulin secretion and is the molecular target of common anti-diabetic sulfonylureas. The cellular processes that control the molecular diversity of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in general and, specifically, in different heart tissues &#x2013; such as atria and ventricles &#x2013; is currently unknown. We, therefore, assessed K<sub>ATP</sub> channel complex assembly, as well as the localization and vesicular trafficking of SUR subunits in different cardiac chambers. We describe the presence of SUR1 in both chambers of the heart &#x2013; calling attention to the controversial notion that sulfonylureas increase cardiovascular risk in type II diabetic patients (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">Garratt et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">Goldner et al., 1971</xref>; <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">Henry, 1998</xref>).</p>

Confocal image sections confirmed previous observations that had been obtained by scanning ion conductance microscopy (<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">Korchev et al., 2000</xref>) that, in ventricular myocytes, SUR2A and Kir6.2 colocalized at the cell surface and at striations where transverse (T-)tubule membrane invaginations occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.&#x2005;1B</xref>). The presence of SUR1 in ventricular myocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.&#x2005;1A</xref>) questions the concept that, in the ventricle, only SUR2A is associated with Kir6.2 (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">Babenko et al., 1998</xref>).</p>

The western blot is representative of eight independent experiments. (F) Treatment with PNGase F glycosidase (PNG F) of solubilized membranes from rat atrial (A) or ventricular (V) tissue to probe whether differences in SUR1 migratory behavior (asterisks) were caused by differential complex glycosylation.

<p>Both SUR1 and SUR2A are glycoproteins; SUR1 is N-glycosylated at positions Asn10 and Asn1050 (<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">Conti et al., 2002</xref>), and sites for N-glycosylation are predicted at Asn9 and Asn330 of SUR2. We, therefore, employed glycosylation analysis to characterize trafficking of these K<sub>ATP</sub> channel subunits within cardiac tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.&#x2005;1C</xref>). The glycosylation of secretory and membrane proteins occurs in different compartments of the secretory pathway because the modifying enzymes are confined to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or different regions of the Golgi (<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985</xref>). Hence, N-glycosylation status &#x2013; i.e. the glycans and the extent of the modification &#x2013; has been used to monitor the progression of such cargo proteins through the secretory pathway. Even without detailed analysis of the composition and length of the attached oligosaccharide, simple enzymatic tools can be used in combination with SDS-PAGE to assess changes in the electrophoretic mobility of cargo proteins, indicative of export from the ER and passage through the Golgi. Specifically, glycans added in the ER (core glycosylation) can be removed by Endoglycosidase H (Endo H), whereas the glycans added in the Golgi (complex glycosylation) are resistant to digestion with Endo H. Peptide-N-Glycosidase F (PNGase F) removes all types of N-glycosylation and can, thus, be used to demonstrate N-glycosylation <italic>per se</italic>.</p>

>paragraph num 9 is 
<p>In heterologous systems, cell surface expression of SUR proteins requires coexpression with Kir6.2 (or homologous Kir6.1) because COPI-dependent Arg-based ER-retrieval signals prevent the release of unassembled subunits from the early secretory pathway (<xref rid="b59" ref-type="bibr">Zerangue et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, the glycosylation status reflects not only the steady-state localization of assembled complexes (the duration of passage through the Golgi, given that the degree of complex glycosylation is defined by the combined action of glycosyltransferases and glycosidases in the respective compartments) but also the assembly status of channel subunits (unassembled SUR proteins remain sensitive to Endo H).</p>

>paragraph num 10 is 
<p>Both SUR1 and SUR2A migrated faster and, hence, are presumably only core-glycosylated in the hearts of <italic>Kcnj11<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.&#x2005;1A</xref>), which suggests that complex-glycosylation of cardiac SUR1 and ventricular SUR2A depends on co-assembly with Kir6.2. Interestingly, in wild-type membranes, atrial and ventricular SUR1 was predominantly Endo-H-resistant and, therefore, complex-glycosylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.&#x2005;1D</xref>). Concomitantly, SUR1 was sensitive to Endo H and, thus, only core-glycosylated in <italic>K</italic><italic>cnj11<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup></italic> hearts. This suggests that, in the heart, Kir6.2 is in both the atria and ventricles is the predominant assembly partner of SUR1. Co-assembly of SUR1 with Kir6.2 throughout the heart was also reflected by the decreased levels of cardiac Kir6.2 in <italic>Abcc8<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup></italic> mice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.141440/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig. S1C,D</ext-link>). SUR1 and Kir6.2 co-assemble in the brain, and the steady-state levels of either protein decreased upon knockout of the gene encoding the partnering subunit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.141440/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig. S1E</ext-link>). Hence, decreased levels of Kir6.2 in the absence of atrial or ventricular SUR1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.141440/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig. S1C,D</ext-link>) is indicative of SUR1-containing K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in both chambers.</p>

<p>Curiously, ventricular SUR1 was, consistently, a faster migrating Endo-H-resistant electrophoretic species compared with atrial SUR1, indicative of differential complex glycosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.&#x2005;1D,E</xref>). Treatment with PNGase F confirmed that SUR1 was complex-glycosylated in both chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.&#x2005;1F</xref>). Indeed, both atrial and ventricular SUR1 migrated more quickly and identically after treatment with PNGase F, confirming that the different electrophoretic mobility of atrial and ventricular SUR1 was due to differential complex glycosylation.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, localization studies in isolated atrial and ventricular myocytes, using antibodies against SUR1 and Kir6.2 (the antibody specificity in the native cardiac environment using knockout controls for the respective antigen is shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.141440/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig. S2A&#x2013;C</ext-link>), revealed that SUR1-containing K<sub>ATP</sub> channels were localized differently when atrial and ventricular myocytes were compared. In atrial myocytes, SUR1 and Kir6.2 colocalized at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.&#x2005;2A</xref>, left panel); however, in ventricular myocytes, SUR2A was visible at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Fig.&#x2005;1B</xref>), but SUR1 did not localize at either the plasma membrane or in T-tubules. Instead, SUR1 was mostly retained in intracellular structures where it colocalized with Kir6.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.&#x2005;2A</xref>, right panel). We confirmed this difference in SUR1 surface localization between atria and ventricles by using a complementary biochemical method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.&#x2005;2B,C</xref>) &#x2013; the labeling of cell-surface-exposed SUR1 by conjugating polyethylene glycol chains to extracellular cysteines (extracellular cysteine PEGylation). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.&#x2005;2D,E</xref> demonstrates the specific labeling of only the complex-glycosylated form of SUR1 upon coexpression with Kir6.2 in HEK293 cells. The Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger NCX1 is an established control protein for extracellular cysteine PEGylation in cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.&#x2005;2B</xref>; <xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2007</xref>) and is present at ventricular T-tubules and the plasma membrane of atrial and ventricular myocytes (<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">Jayasinghe et al., 2009</xref>). NCX1 was labeled with similar efficacy in both cell types, implying that all regions of the cell surface were accessible to the PEGylation reagent. By contrast, labeling of SUR1 was at least three times higher in atrial, compared with ventricular, myocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.&#x2005;2B,C</xref>), supporting the conclusion that more SUR1 is present at the plasma membrane of atrial than ventricular myocytes.</p>

Kir6.2 and Na,K are not PEGylated and serve as negative controls. The western blot is representative of three independent experiments quantified in C.

We, therefore, conclude that SUR1, which has functional properties distinct from SUR2A (<xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">Okuyama et al., 1998</xref>), assembles with Kir6.2 in atrial and ventricular myocytes; however, SUR1-containing K<sub>ATP</sub> complexes are expressed at the cell surface of atrial myocytes but are predominantly intracellular in ventricular myocytes.</p>

<p>Colocalization analysis of SUR1 and the vesicle docking protein p115 (<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura et al., 1997</xref>), a marker of the cis-Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig.&#x2005;3B</xref>), showed that the Golgi were either juxtanuclear or scattered throughout both atrial and ventricular myocytes (<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">Fawcett and McNutt, 1969</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.141440/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig. S2D</ext-link>), and that the majority of ventricular SUR1-containing K<sub>ATP</sub> channels was localized to the Golgi. Treatment with neuraminidase, which cleaves the glycosidic linkages of sialic acids, increased the electrophoretic mobility of atrial SUR1, which subsequently migrated close to the untreated ventricular form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig.&#x2005;3C</xref>), indicating that atrial SUR1 is modified by sialic acid residues. Ventricular SUR1 was minimally affected by neuraminidase treatment, suggesting that both SUR1 forms carry the specific sugar moieties that are recognized by this exoglycosidase, but to different degrees. Because protein sialyltransferases are present in the medial and trans-Golgi compartments (<xref rid="b61" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>), ventricular SUR1-containing K<sub>ATP</sub> channels move at least as far as the medial Golgi, from where they are, presumably, retrieved due to recognition by the COPI-coat (<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">Michelsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="b59" ref-type="bibr">Zerangue et al., 1999</xref>). Consistent with the differing electrophoretic mobility shifts upon treatment with neuraminidase, the atrial and ventricular forms of SUR1 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 bound wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which specifically binds to <italic>N-</italic>acetylglucosamine, and neuraminic and sialic acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig.&#x2005;3D</xref>). Notably, the complement of proteins that was eluted from the WGA matrix was similar between atrial and ventricular proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig.&#x2005;3E</xref>), suggesting that only a subset of WGA-binding proteins have varying glycosylation profiles. Thus, the differences in the migratory behaviors of SUR1 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 might reflect different residence times in the medial and trans-Golgi compartments, due to retrieval of these select cargo proteins. We conclude that Kir6.2&#x2013;SUR1 complexes are retained within the Golgi of ventricular, but not atrial, myocytes, and that Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 is an independent and functionally essential cargo protein that is differentially glycosylated according to whether it is expressed in atria or ventricles. Thus, the secretory pathways of atrial and ventricular myocytes might differ in their control of the trafficking of membrane proteins besides K<sub>ATP</sub>.</p>

<p>In heterologous expression, SUR1-containing K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are more sensitive to activation by Mg-nucleotide diphosphates (MgADP) than are SUR2A-containing channels (<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">Masia et al., 2005</xref>). Hence, Golgi-retained SUR1-containing channels might provide a fully assembled pool of channels that, if subsequently trafficked to the cell surface, could provide enhanced metabolism-sensing and protection from the deleterious consequences of energy depletion. Kir6.2-containing K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are known to contribute to the shortening of action potentials during catecholaminergic stress that is mediated by &#x3B2;-adrenergic receptors (<xref rid="b62" ref-type="bibr">Zingman et al., 2002</xref>), but the SUR composition of these channels is unknown. We applied the selective &#x3B2;-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (ISO) with the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor rolipram (ROL) (Lehnart et al., 2005) to intact hearts for 1&#x2005;h. In ventricular myocytes isolated from hearts that had been treated with ISO and ROL, we observed substantial spatial reorganization of the dispersed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.&#x2005;2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Fig.&#x2005;4A</xref> &#x2018;control&#x2019;) SUR1 signal into regular striation-associated fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Fig.&#x2005;4A&#x2013;C</xref>). This raises the possibility that SUR1-containing K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are inserted into the cell surface membrane, particularly into T-tubule membranes. Notably, the spatial distribution of the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger NCX1, which localizes to the plasma membrane of ventricular myocytes within, and outside of, T-tubules, was not affected by sustained &#x3B2;-adrenergic stimulation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.141440/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig. S3A&#x2013;C</ext-link>) but did overlap with SUR1 after treatment with ISO and ROL (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.141440/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig. S3D</ext-link>).

<p>K<sub>ATP</sub> channels belong to a group of cargo proteins that recruit 14-3-3 proteins, yet where in the cell this occurs is unknown (<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">Heusser et al., 2006</xref>). The 14-3-3-dependent cargo proteins TASK-1 (another K<sup>+</sup> channel) and ADAM22 (a catalytically inactive metalloproteinase) both accumulate in cis- and medial-, but not trans-, Golgi compartments in the absence of an interaction with 14-3-3 (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">G&#xF6;dde et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b63" ref-type="bibr">Zuzarte et al., 2009</xref>), and we hypothesized that ventricular SUR1&#x2013;Kir6.2 K<sub>ATP</sub> channels have insufficient interaction with 14-3-3 proteins during intra-Golgi trafficking, which results in constitutive Golgi localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.&#x2005;2</xref>) and reduced sialylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig.&#x2005;3</xref>). The levels of 14-3-3 protein were markedly lower in ventricular myocytes compared with those from atria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Fig.&#x2005;5A,B</xref>), raising the possibility that the reduced availability of the 14-3-3 protein limits cell surface expression of SUR1&#x2013;Kir6.2 K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in ventricles. Immunofluorescence staining of atrial myocytes, by using an antibody that recognises all 14-3-3 isoforms, revealed strong labeling of juxtanuclear, submembraneous and intracellular compartments, including a weak striated pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Fig.&#x2005;5C</xref>, AM). In ventricular myocytes, 14-3-3 immunostaining was much weaker (compare <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.141440/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig. S2D</ext-link>) and was primarily restricted to intracellular striations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Fig.&#x2005;5C</xref>, VM), suggestive of a specific association with Z-lines and T-tubule junctions of the ER. In both atrial and ventricular myocytes, there was a substantial colocalization of 14-3-3 with p115 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Fig.&#x2005;5C</xref>), which was adjacent to Z-lines of ventricular myocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Fig.&#x2005;5D</xref>), suggesting that cardiac 14-3-3 proteins are present at the Golgi apparatus. This colocalization is consistent with previous observations that have shown overlapping immunofluorescence patterns for GM130, a p115-interacting Golgi matrix protein (<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura et al., 1997</xref>), and 14-3-3 in HeLa cells (<xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">Preisinger et al., 2004</xref>). Intriguingly, the localization of these Golgi elements in the vicinity of Z-lines coincides with the previous observation that coated vesicles are frequently observed in this region, but are only sometimes connected to the ER (<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">Fawcett and McNutt, 1969</xref>). The colocalization of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels with p115, and the different sialylation profiles of atrial and ventricular SUR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Fig.&#x2005;3</xref>) suggests that the channel complexes are stalled in Golgi elements, possibly as part of a dedicated secretory pathway between the ER and T-tubules at Z-lines.</p>

<p>Six mammalian 14-3-3 isoforms were expressed in isolated myocytes, the most abundant were 14-3-3&#x3B5; and 14-3-3&#x3B7;, but ventricular myocytes expressed every isoform to a lower extent compared with atrial myocytes (35&#x2013;75% less mRNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Fig.&#x2005;5E</xref>), this is consistent with the hypothesis that ventricular K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are retained because of a reduced abundance of 14-3-3 isoforms. The results presented here raise the novel possibility that, in terminally differentiated cell types, such as cardiac myocytes, the availability of 14-3-3 proteins might be important in the regulation of the surface expression of specific cargoes, and that the availability of 14-3-3 proteins might underlie differences in the expression of functionally important cell surface proteins.</p>

Importantly, the antibody against PKA phosphorylated substrates blocked the binding of Kir6.2 to the Phos-tag affinity matrix from hearts that had been treated with ISO and ROL.

<p>Next, we tested the possible consequences of PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Kir6.2 on channel trafficking by using an <italic>in vitro</italic> binding experiment to capture the inherently transient interaction with trafficking machinery, such as the COPI vesicle coat.

SUR1-containing K<sub>ATP</sub> channels constitutively reach the cell surface in only atrial myocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Fig.&#x2005;2</xref>), potentially, because of the high abundance of 14-3-3 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f05">Fig.&#x2005;5</xref>), which are required to overcome the COPI-dependent retrieval signals present in Kir6.2 and SUR1 (<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">Heusser et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">Michelsen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="b58" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2003</xref>).

Our results are consistent with previous reports that have demonstrated the contribution of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels to action potential shortening under these conditions (<xref rid="b62" ref-type="bibr">Zingman et al., 2002</xref>) but clarify the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel subunits that are involved and indicate that the phenomenon relies on PKA-regulated deployment of SUR1-containing channels to the ventricular cell surface in T-tubules.</p>

<p><bold>Model of the regulated deployment of SUR1&#x2013;Kir6.2 K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in ventricular myocytes.</bold> (A) Agonist (isoproterenol) binding to &#x3B2; -adrenergic receptors (&#x3B2;-AR) triggers the activation of the adenylyl cyclase (AC) through a &#x3B2;-AR-coupled G-protein, resulting in elevation of cAMP and the activation of PKA. Attenuation of signal transduction through degradation of cAMP by phosphodiesterase (PDE) was inhibited using the PDE4-specific inhibitor rolipram. Known PKA targets include the voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2) and the Ryanodine receptor (RyR2), culminating in elevation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> [by release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores and by influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. The phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN) by PKA relieves its inhibitory effect on the SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump (SERCA). For simplicity, the relevant PKA holoenzyme has been depicted as being cytosolic and not membrane associated. (B) PKA dependent phosphorylation of S372 (adjacent to the Arg-based ER retrieval signal) in Kir6.2 releases Golgi-stored SUR1&#x2013;Kir6.2 K<sub>ATP</sub> channels from COPI binding, thus, facilitating Golgi exit. An unknown kinase anchoring protein (AKAP), conceivably, localizes PKA to the vicinity of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. (C) Deployment of SUR1-containing K<sub>ATP</sub> channels from the Golgi to the T-tubular plasma membrane. Hypothetically, signal transduction might affect the available pool of 14-3-3 proteins, in addition to direct phosphorylation of cargo proteins, by shifting the equilibrium between an engaged (substrate bound) and available (substrate free) pool, thus, overcoming the limitations of cell surface expression of 14-3-3 substrates by the limited availability of 14-3-3 proteins.</p>

>paragraph num 32 is 
<p>Our results identify a novel molecular mechanism that utilizes COPI-dependent storage in the Golgi for the regulated cell surface expression of a key cargo protein. Strikingly, most of the characterized Arg-based retrieval signals are flanked by serine residues, some of which are known targets of phosphorylation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.141440/-/DC1">supplementary material Table S2</ext-link>). Thus, interaction with COPI coat proteins might &#x2013; in addition to providing an assembly checkpoint &#x2013; be harnessed in terminally differentiated cell types to allow regulated deployment from the Golgi to the cell surface. Therefore, COPI-dependent storage and COPI-regulated deployment might explain conflicting results that implicate the activity of Arg-based signals in retrieval, as well as exit, from the early secretory pathway (compare references in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcs.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/jcs.141440/-/DC1">supplementary material Table S2</ext-link>). We suggest a mechanism as to how SUR1-containing K<sub>ATP</sub> channels could be released from COPI- and 14-3-3-dependent control and, hence, play a previously unrecognized role in the cAMP-dependent &#x2018;fight-or-flight&#x2019; response of the heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f07">Figs&#x2005;7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f08">8</xref>).
