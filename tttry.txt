Elegant structural studies of the human neuronal fusion proteins (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>) have shown that several Sec17 molecules can bind along a bundle of 4 SNARE helices with the C-terminus of each Sec17 near the membrane-distal end of the coiled SNARE domains, where Sec18 also binds to the SNARE bundle, with the central region of Sec17 in contact with the SNAREs, and with the Sec17 N-terminal region near the C-termini of the SNARE domains, immediately adjacent to the bilayer and where the Sec17 apolar loop may insert into lipid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Mutations within &#x3B1;SNAP/Sec17 allow tests of the functional importance of each of these Sec17 interactions. The F21S,M22S mutation of Sec17 removes the apolar character of a loop of Sec17 near its N-terminus (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Winter et al., 2009</xref>), the L291A,L292A mutation near the C-terminus of Sec17 alters its interaction with Sec18 (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Barnard et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Schwartz and Merz, 2009</xref>), and a conserved lysyl residue at position 163 in &#x3B1;SNAP (corresponding to residue 159 and/or 163 in Sec17) is positioned near the SNARE complex zero-layer where it is important for functional interactions (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). In an earlier study at higher SNARE concentrations, Sec17-F21S,M22S was found to be fully-functional for supporting Sec18-mediated SNARE complex disassembly for the fusion of 4-SNARE proteoliposomes, but did not stimulate fusion of R- and Q-SNARE proteoliposomes in the absence of Sec18 (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Zick et al., 2015</xref>). The opposite was true of Sec17-L291A,L292A; it was inactive in helping Sec18 to promote 4-SNARE proteoliposome fusion, but was fully active in promoting Sec18-independent fusion of either vacuoles or proteoliposomes (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Schwartz and Merz, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Zick et al., 2015</xref>). Model studies with liposomes have shown that wild-type Sec17 can interact cooperatively with a mixture of vacuolar SNAREs without their membrane anchors (termed &#x2018;soluble SNAREs,&#x2019; or sSNAREs), forming a 4sSNARE:oligo-Sec17 complex which binds to liposomes far more efficiently than either the sSNAREs alone or the Sec17 alone (Figure 7 of <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Zick et al., 2015</xref>).

A strictly membrane-binding function might be bypassed by a synthetic transmembrane anchor, which itself would not be expected to disturb the bilayer. We therefore fused the trans-membrane (TM) anchor of the vacuolar Qb SNARE Vti1 to the N-terminus of Sec17 or Sec17-F21S,M22S to create TM-Sec17 and TM-Sec17-F21S,M22S and purified each of the resulting recombinant fusion proteins.

In the &#x2018;trans-SNARE stability&#x2019; model, the bound Sec17 would associate with the SNAREs to allow the three remaining C-terminal portions of the SNARE domains of the R-, Qa-, and Qb-SNAREs to be drawn together and to thereby draw the membranes more closely together, in effect substituting for the deleted Qc portion of the zipper. Optical tweezer studies (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2016</xref>) have shown that Sec17 (&#x3B1;-SNAP) binding can stabilize almost fully-zippered 4-SNARE bundles, a process of &#x2018;conformational selection,&#x2019; rather than enhance the forward rate of zippering.

For example, binding of phospholipids and coat proteins to the autoinhibitory C-terminal domain of Drs2 could ensure that its activity is coupled to vesicle formation (<xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Hanamatsu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Neo1 has a very short C-terminus and an extended N-terminus that contains the Snx3 sorting motif. The N-terminal tails of <span>ATP</span>9A and 9B also specify their differential localization, suggesting this region of the protein binds regulatory proteins (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Takatsu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Although the yeast Snx3 sorting motif is not conserved in <span>ATP</span>9A or <span>ATP</span>9B, other sequences found in Neo1 are present within a region of <span>ATP</span>9B that is necessary and sufficient for Golgi targeting (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Takatsu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).

Proteoliposomes with Ypt7 and the R-SNARE Nyv1 were incubated with HOPS and sQa, sQb, and GST-tagged Qc for 90 min (lane 3), 30 min (lane 2), or 5 min (lane 1), solubilized in 1% CHAPS, and mixed with glutathione-magnetic beads as described in <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>. Where indicated, incubations contained detergent from the start (lanes 4&#x2013;6), were performed without HOPS (lanes 7&#x2013;9), without sQa (lanes 10&#x2013;12), without sQb (lanes 13&#x2013;15), or with wild-type Qc in place of GST-Qc (lanes 16&#x2013;18). Protein inputs were 5 pmol of integrally bound R, 8 pmol each of sQa, sQb, and Qc, and 0.5 pmol of HOPS.

With few exceptions, SNAREs are tail-anchored (TA) proteins, bearing a C-terminal hydrophobic domain that is essential for their membrane integration. Recently, the Guided Entry of Tail-anchored proteins (GET) pathway was described in mammalian and yeast cells that serve as a blueprint of TA protein insertion [Schuldiner M, et al. (2008) <italic>Cell</italic> 134(4):634&#x2013;645; Stefanovic S, Hegde RS (2007) <italic>Cell</italic> 128(6):1147&#x2013;1159]. This pathway consists of six proteins, with the cytosolic <span>ATP</span>ase GET3 chaperoning the newly synthesized TA protein posttranslationally from the ribosome to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Structural and biochemical insights confirmed the potential of pathway components to facilitate membrane insertion, but the physiological significance in multicellular organisms remains to be resolved. Our phylogenetic analysis of 37 GET3 orthologs from 18 different species revealed the presence of two different GET3 clades. We identified and analyzed GET pathway components in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and found reduced root hair elongation in <italic>Atget</italic> lines, possibly as a result of reduced SNARE biogenesis. Overexpression of <italic>At</italic>GET3a in a receptor knockout (KO) results in severe growth defects, suggesting presence of alternative insertion pathways while highlighting an intricate involvement for the GET pathway in cellular homeostasis of plants.</p></td><td>(ATP)|ATP</td></tr><tr><td>27738552</td><td><p>None of the P4-<span>ATP</span>ases, including Neo1, localize to the vacuole membrane when expressed at endogenous levels or when modestly overexpressed.<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11,12,14,40,41</sup></xref> Neo1 primarily localizes to the Golgi and we could only detect GFP-Neo1 in the vacuole membrane when expressed from a very strong GPD promoter on a multicopy plasmid, which should generate more than 100-fold more Neo1 than WT cells.<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Mutation of a retromer component involved in late endosome to Golgi retrieval of proteins also led to vacuolar localization at more modest levels of Neo1 expression.

It is more likely that PE traveling the secretory pathway toward the vacuole is concentrated in the cytosolic leaflet by Neo1 at the level of the Golgi or late endosome prior to arrival at the vacuole. Loss of Neo1 activity could therefore lead to less PE in the cytosolic leaflet of the vacuoles. It is also possible that sorting of SNAREs involved in vacuolar fusion is partially perturbed by <italic>neo1</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup> mutants at the level of the endosomes or Golgi, thereby reducing their concentration in the vacuolar membrane leading to reduced fusion.

A recent <italic>in vivo</italic> study in yeast has challenged these interpretations, concluding that fusion required solely lumenal acidification but not the V<sub>0</sub> sector itself. Here, we identify the reasons for this discrepancy and reconcile it. We find that acute pharmacological or physiological inhibition of V-<span>ATP</span>ase pump activity de-acidifies the vacuole lumen in living yeast cells within minutes. Time-lapse microscopy revealed that de-acidification induces vacuole fusion rather than inhibiting it. Cells expressing mutated V<sub>0</sub> subunits that maintain vacuolar acidity were blocked in this fusion.
